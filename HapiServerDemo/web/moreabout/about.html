        <h1>About this Server</h1>
        This server is intended to demonstrate the HAPI protocol, 
        to provide a server for clients to test against, and to 
        allow experimentation.

        <h2>Wheel Thingy</h2>
        <p>This is 27 pixels extracted from an image of an residential power meter, with the
        hope that one day the number of times it spins around could be counted.  
        Here is the image of the power meter:<br>
        <image src="drawing.png"></br>
        and the Autoplot script that reads the data: <a href="powerWheel.jyds">powerWheel.jyds</a>

        <h2>SpectrogramRank2</h2>
        <p>This is an example of how high-rank data (data with multiple dependencies, besides time and channel) could be transmitted via HAPI.
