        <p>This server also supports experimental data ingest.  If the server
        configuration at HAPI_HOME/keys/ contains a key for a data product,
        then this allows post requests to insert data into the server.
        For example, the scientist if digitizing data and this allows the data
        to be stored in a common location.
        </p>
        <p>A multipart upload is needed to push data.  This should contain the
            firstly "key" which secures the server.  This is a unique string
            known to the server implementation and to the client using it.  
            (Presently this is an 8-digit number.)  Second, the post contains
            the csv-formatted data in "data".</p>
        <p>This Python code shows how to push data.  Suppose you have a chicken
            coop with a Raspberry PI and a temperature sensor.  We wish to 
            regularly store the temperature of the chicken coop by pushing data
            into a HAPI server.  Here is the Python code:
            <br><code><pre>
import requests 
data = {'key':'12345678', 
        'data':'2021-01-01T00:00Z,-4.4\n2021-01-01T01:00Z,-4.6\n'} 
r = requests.post(url = 'http://localhost:8084/HapiServerDemo/hapi/data?id=chickens', data = data)  
                </pre></code><br>
Note the server is able to get the key from the post part of the request.                
        <p>wget can be used to insert a record as well:
            <br><code><pre>
wget --post-data='data=2002-02-02T00:00Z,4.56' 'http://localhost:8084/HapiServerDemo/hapi/data?id=chickens&key=12345678&data=2002-02-02T00:00Z,4.56'       
                </pre></code><br>
