        <h1>About this Server</h1>
        This server is intended to demonstrate the HAPI protocol, 
        to provide a server for clients to test against, and to 
        allow experimentation.

        This is 27 pixels extracted from an image of my power meter, with the
        hope that I can one day count the number of times it spins around.  
        Here is the image of the power meter:<br>
