<p>Special capabilities are offered by some data sources to provide additional functionality, such as TimeSeriesBrowse.  
<li>TimeSeriesBrowse is where the data 
    source can construct URIs to read any time span. 
<li>Caching is used when it's convenient for data sources to read in several data sets at once, and 
    clients should query to see if other datasets have been loaded already.  
<li>Updating allows the data source to ask clients to come back and ask for a new 
    version of the data sets.
