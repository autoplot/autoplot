    <p>PyQDataSet and PyDatum are wrappers which make infix operations possible
with these Das2 objects.  For example, calling ds+2 calls the method __add__(2)
of the PyQDataSet called ds.  Additionally, PyQDataSets can always be modified
and a copy of the data might be made to allow this, since QDataSets are often 
immutable.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Additional commands are added to Jython to make it more useful, like the
        dataset command which converts Python arrays and Datums into QDataSets
        and getDataSet which reads URIs into a PyQDataSet for scripting.
    </p>
    <p>This package contains support for completions and control GUI generation.
Both of these have the similar task that they need to quickly generate code
which can be executed to get a result.  For example, when completions are 
triggered, we run a simplified version of the script which allows us to query
for completions.  When a GUI is needed a simplified version of the script which
only has the "getParam" calls is created.
