<p>New 100% Java CDF file reader that uses NIO to manage memory.  This is based on the
latest version of the pure Java CDF reader from NASA/GSFC (not the JNI-based one), and uses
NIO to map in memory when data is contiguous in the CDF file, and native memory (not the JVM memory) 
when data must be reassembled off the disk.</p>
