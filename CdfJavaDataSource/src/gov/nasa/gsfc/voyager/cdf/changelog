Version 0.5
    Addresses a feature in CDFs generated using the cdf library. In certain
cases the Variable Descriptor record may indicate that the data for a variable
is compressed, but the actual data may not be compressed if the library
determines that the uncompressed data is of smaller size than the compressed
data would be. This condition typically occurs for variables which are not
record variant.
Previous version of this package would fail when this feature was present,
because it would look for a variable value record with the signature of CVVR
if the descriptor indicated that the variable is compressed.
