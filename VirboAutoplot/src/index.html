        <p><small>Introduction of the TimeRangeTool helps to compose orbit ranges.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rte_0686841638: [] in qstream comments are now okay</li>
            <li>rte_0018238427: URI is not absolute, when exporting on Windows</li>
            <li>Messenger CDF variable used sparse records.</li>
            <li>pngwalk tool supports .pngwalk files from within the tool, before they wouldn't show up in completions.</li>
            <li>.pngwalk files work properly when versioning is used.</li>
            <li>singleInstanceListener detects "pngwalk:" and does this automatically in a new pngwalk.</li>
            <li>in aggregation dialog, use a JTextField so long URIs don't mess up the GUI.</li>
            <li>tweak menu labels in the file menu</li>
            <li>fix one place in CDF codes where FUNCTION wasn't support were FUNCT was.  FUNCT is the new word.</li>
            <li>IndexOutOfBounds RTE in Pngwalk filmstrip view</li>
            <li>Jython negative indeces were supported for ranges (ds[-3:-1]) but not for single indexes (ds[-3]) or lists (ds[[-3,-2,-1]]</li>
            <li>3579786: LSpec routine handles fill more gracefully</li>
            <li>LSpec would shift result one bin</li>
            <li>3578171: code clean up broke forgotten feature where an http file could be plotted even if it wasn't part of http filesystem. Thanks Tami and Darren!</li>
            <li>3578229: orbit 00003 and 3 were not recognized as equivalent as other codes see it, so pngwalks would fail.</li>
            <li>3577939: orbit files must have at least one valid orbit because mediawiki doesn't provide file-not-found code</li>
            <li>make pngwalk would fail to show pngwalk when version was used.  Thanks Matt!</li>
            <li>3578898: improve feedback in spectograms when all timetags appear to be fill.</li>
            <li>rte_1710483042: check for RENDER_TYPE assumed that the result was non-null.</li>
            <li>rank 2 depend_1 can switch back and forth between stack of line plots and spectrogram</li>
            <li>reduce the number of processor threads (for now) in hopes to reduce load on Dan's server, which sometimes drops plots</li>
            <li>events data set in qdataset didn't render properly because under-implemented copy method dropped properties.</li>
            <li>fixes for bugs found in CDAWeb source discovered by Bob's plot everything script.</li>
            <li>old "|slice(2)" was mis-handled in metadata sprocess, causing RTE</li>

            <li>3576060: jython data source doesn't have timerange set before going into editor, causing jumps to default time</li>
            <li>3575260: keep track of last location, because Ubuntu 12.04 opens windows up in odd places (off screen with 2 displays)</li>
            <li>remove unnecessary synchronized block in DasAxis</li>
            <li>rte_1627148566: Pure-java CDF didn't close files propertly, causing RTEs on Windows.</li>
            <li>enumeration of integers didn't set the editor GUI properly: http://www.rbsp-ect.lanl.gov/data_pub/autoplot/scripts/rbsp_ect_lvt.jyds</li>
            <li>Recent CDAWeb move broke code that handled exceptional file naming, as with ace/cris/level_2_cdaweb/cris_h3</li>
            <li>Recent change broke the spectrogram when a dataset was both a rank 2 table and a bundle, as with Seth's data</li>
            <li>frame title is set on the event thread after seeing hang on Ubuntu 12.04</li>
            <li>empty pngwalk sequence would produce runtime error</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
