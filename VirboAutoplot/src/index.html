        <p><small>The Financial Times proposes an improved U.S. Electorial College map, without the bias issues (Results from 2012 election).  Here's <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3685bf9e-a4cc-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1"> the article</a>.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2016a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Experimental <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot.dmg">Mac Release</a> is available.
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2016-11-12 r19933):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>1708: digitizer component fails when the first column was not time, because code assumed times with timeFormatter.
            <li>data set selector component setValue would add "%20" when there was an extra space at the end when cut-n-paste URIs.
            <li>rte_1741708130: rendering of rank 3 waveform would fail w/NullPointerException when within one packet.  Thanks, Nhan!
            <li>slightly tighten the check for JSON headed-ascii files by looking for a colon between the braces.
            <li>Use last HAPI server by default.  Jon's elasticbeanstalk is the default server.
            <li>reducex supports rank 2 bundle without DEPEND_0, and independent tags in the first column.
            <li>demo HAPI server had Jython library issues, where it was assumed that VirboAutoplot was on the path.
            <li>html data source would fail with http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~jbf/autoplot/users/jeremy/20161027/cubs.html, because wrong index was used.
            <li>eventsBar last color used was used for the gantt label colors, instead of the color property.
            <li>vap+das2Server and vap+das2server were not treated as equivalent, causing "add plot from" initialization feature to fail.
            <li>1699: noise on FiltersChainPanel dialog.
            <li>launcher script for jumbojars would insert a space, causing --help to fail
            <li>more findbugs cleanup (nothing serious)
            <li>Move local data cache has progress bar and allows cancel.</li>
            <li>Binary Data Source gets format keyword, and properly supports %c.</li>
            <li>IDL/Matlab interface supports reading PLANE_0 correlated planes.</li>
            <li>HAPI client supports binary, when format=binary is added to URI.</li>
            <li>1695: dashup issues pointed out by Kris, including my functions persist and proper support for TSB.</li>
            <li>setDepend0Cadence no longer resets axes and plot type.  Thanks, Chris!</li>
            <li>Binary Data Source includes completion for Nybbles.</li>
            <li>1693: ephemeris/tca forces $Y-$m-$d when $Y-$j should be shown.  Thanks, Chris!</li>
            <li>StackedHistogram allows inconvertible units.</li>            
            <li>properly register the LogConsole as the handler for log messages, so that LoggerManager.getLogger("myanalysis") is handled.</li>
            <li>jython completions are sorted</li>
            <li>Round of findbugs code cleanup (no visible bugs found).</li>
            <li>Bookmarks demo1 changed to CDAWEB, after years of problems with the OpenDap URIs.</li>
            <li>Added ability for each plane in a TableDataSet to have its own properties.  Thanks, Chris!</li>
            <li>stackedHistogram labels were not set properly for doInterpretMetadata.  Thanks, Chris!</li>
            <li>1691: rank &gt;0 datasets treated as number type, implying that __float__ could be called.</li>
            <li>1686: always enter the editor for the open local action, so that Overplot or Plot Below can be selected.</li>
            <li>Digital renderer properly sets the font.  Unify rank2 and rank1 code for consistent behavior.</li>
            <li>DafaultTimeSeriesBrowse improves error feedback by checking for null uri.</li>
            <li>finally figure out why vertical axis sometimes clips the top tick.</li>
            <li>Some automatic layout actions would occur when autolayout switch was off.  Thanks, Ivar!</li>
            <li>1687: completions on jython import package names shows javadoc</li>
            <li>add filters dialog is resizeable.   Thanks Chris!</li>
            <li>Ed found "hey man" debugging print statement left in code.  Now a useful message is printed.</li>
            <li>clarify dbAboveBackgroundDim1 GUI, and allow selection of 10 or 20 factor for fields intensity or power.  Thanks Chris!</li>
            <li>DecimalFormat, often used to display decimal numbers and in das2streams and QStreams, was using banker's rounding (HALF_EVEN), instead of HALF_UP.</li>
            <li>various bugs with the HAPI GUI.</li>
            <li>QStream ASCII formats used banker's rounding, so 44.5 would have been rounded to 44.0.  Now 0.5 is rounded up.</li>
            <li>1679: HAPI JSON would confuse Rich ASCII support.</li>
            <li>improve feedback for qstreams when values are found in both the packet descriptor and in the packets.</li>
            <li>applyIndex supports BUNDLE_i.</li>
            <li>Series renderer plotSymbols would show when units were inconvertible, but then connectors would refuse to paint.  Now both will paint with a warning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
