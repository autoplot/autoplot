        <img alt="screenshot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>Voyager PRA data is easy read in with the BinaryDataSource and the JythonDataSource.  You can look at <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/jyds/voyagerPRA.jyds">the script</a> that creates this plot.</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvements to make aggregation GUI requested by Reiner.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the Feedback GUI to support use in firewalled environment that doesn't allow post.</li>
            <li>Minor corrections to data tab/slice area, including slice indexes is always enabled.  And focus dataset toString is displayed for reference.</li>
            <li>3487247: make sure remote bookmark is not editable, since edits would be lost once the remote are read in again.</li>
            <li>Jython ds[:,0] implemented with unbundle should have disallowed high-rank unbundle (which allows a rank 3 dataset to be stored in a rank 2 table.)</li>
            <li>DataSourceEditorDialog is always created on the event thread, avoiding occasional hang in JythonDataSource</li>
            <li>rte_0076363774_20120128_090924: sloppiness in the trim function of DDataSet </li>
            <li>In JythonDataSource, try to add the TSB capability immediately, so this behaves like a proper TSB-capable data source.</li>
            <li>Fixes to single-instance launch</li>
            <li>delay construction of axes and style tabs to work-around 1 sec delay in GUI on Mac.</li>
            <li>bugfixes in Bx|fftPower(512).  fftPower result is marked as a qube.</li>
            <li>weightsDataSet handles bundles.</li>
            <li>BUNDLE_1 should not be propogated through binaryOp and unaryOp.</li>
            <li>3116643: data sources with TimeSeriesBrowse, that have a URI without the timerange, are accepted by binding automatically to the application timerange.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3484946: A change in v2011a_7 caused datasets to fail to automatically bind to the application timerange.</li>
            <li>old code from original Autoplot was ignored render type guess code and set this based on monotonic property.</li>
            <li>3484940: guessCadenceNew would not tally deltas properly, resulting in incorrect cadence=0 for vap+inline:0,0,100,100,0,0;0,0,0,100,100,0</li>
            <li>link(x,y) shouldn't return a bundle dataset, it should return y(x).</li>
            <li>fftFilter threw out units.</li>
            <li>3482782: stress testing revealed some interesting memory leaks.  These are addressed.</li>
            <li>bugfixes in SeriesRenderer error bars and outline fillStyle when printing pointed out by Jon V.</li>
            <li>3198392: bookmarks update while user is in the menu would cause them to not update properly.  Now this is done on event thread.</li>
            <li>bugfix in cdf/java checking on variable lengths.  rank 2 data would indicate a length mismatch because of old code.</li>
            <li>ArrayDataSet trim didn't trim PLANE_0 property.  Now we use DataSetUtil.trimProperties for consistent behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>initial support for CDF TT2000 in CDF/Java reader.  Use vap+cdfj: to try this out</li>
            <li>toTimeDataSet(yr,mn,day,hour,min,sec,nano) introduced</li>
            <li>position=&lt;int&gt; command line option added to support web sites that want to build applications using webstart single instance feature.</li>
            <li>dbAboveBackgroundDim1 and dbAboveBackgroundDim0 operations introduced for Plasma Wave Group.</li>
            <li>Reset Zoom->Reset Y (Ctrl+Shift+Y) and Reset Zoom->Reset X introduced.</li>
            <li>minor changes to das2 library to allow top and bottom decorators, and opaque plots.</li>
            <li>introduce dbAboveBackgroundDim1 filter for RPWS group</li>
            <li>basic mode automatically switches over to timerange mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>getParam in jython scripts can be enumeration: getParam('sc','1','spacecraft',['1','2','3','4'])</li>
            <li>add FFTFilterType.TenPercentEdgeCosine for use with waves.</li>
            <li>resourceUri handled specially in JythonDataSource editor.</li>
            <li>support %{USER_PROPERTIES.x.y} and %{METADATA.x.y} in legend label.</li>
            <li>3479591: tearoff tabs can be dropped into child container</li>
        </ul>

<p>Known issues:</p>

<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>
