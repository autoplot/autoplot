        <p><small>The screenshots tool is used to document use of the screenshots tool.  Here's the result: <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/tutorials/20160116meta/20160116_1426.html">Making a tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/tutorials/20160116/20160116_1330.html">tutorial</a> made.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2015a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>relax timeout on read to 60 seconds, because sometimes the das2server would take more 10 seconds before sending out data.</li>
            <li>1510: pngwalks of aggregations of sparse data, limitation is no longer needed, and we just don't look for gaps when this would be impractical.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
