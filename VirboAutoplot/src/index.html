        <p><small>Moire patterns in problematic RBSP mag data</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>axis visible=false now works nicely with fix layout.</li>
            <li>timestamps in FTP still prevented updates from happening. </li>
            <li>automatic labelling when stack-of-lineplots used</li>
            <li>jyds time series browse wouldn't work because of botched bugfix from 2012/8/16.</li>
            <li>jyds has scroll pane when there are lots of parameters.</li>
            <li>total, smooth, and collapse properly propagate metadata.</li>
            <li>PDF fonts are painted in Java itext library, resulting in a closer screen representation, but text is no longer editable for post-processing</li>
            <li>new code that forced series to be used when CDF indicated the type needs to detect implicit waveform type</li>
            <li>further investigation into making sure that offline means http is really offline.</li>
            <li>contoursRender is properly bound to color and line thick.</li>
            <li>bugfixes in export to wav file</li>
            <li>preserve render_type=spectrogram property through rank 3 to rank 2 slice.</li>
            <li>pngwalk now has show missing off by default.</li>
            <li>rte_0409055860: tooltip html was not properly escaped with &amp;lt; which resulted in a runtime error.</li>
            <li>rte 0449679029: look for ") " instead of just " " because of reducex needs it</li>
            <li>running flag prevented TimeSeriesBrowse from retickling the tickle timer and left unfinished operations pending.</li>
            <li>remove "import graph" from Jython scripts, which was causing problems and was not necessary.</li>
            <li>add makeChildPlotElement so that this is more of an atomic operation</li>
            <li>restore --bookmarks= command line switch, which was probably broken with remote bookmarks loading.</li>
            <li>guessSlice didn't consider existing slice, causing problems with high-rank datasets.</li>
            <li>bugfix 3440253: add test for http lastModified</li>
            <li>ascii parser error messages limited to once per file, to support batch processing</li>
            <li>report a warning when "open=bookmarks:...." is used instead of "--open=bookmarks..."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>das2 ephemeris labels wouldn't show up when legend labels would show component labels.</li>

            <li>"&lt;url&gt; &lt;COMP&gt;" would trigger index out of bounds because of trim.</li>
            <li>more mucking with how the transitions operate to support bundles of mageis stuff at LANL, trying to get autoranging to work correctly</li>
            <li>users can switch back and forth between series and spectrogram with complex slices</li>
            <li>limits on slices applied in the GUI to avoid index out of bounds errors</li>
            <li>support ISO8601 times spans like "2012-04-05T00:00/PT0.1S".  Before the seconds had to be an integers.</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
