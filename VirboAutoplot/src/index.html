        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use CDF library 3.4.1 to avoid initial delay when reading CDF files</li>
            <li>CDAWeb gets everything over HTTP, and from new location "http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/sp_phys/data/"</li>
            <li>NetCDF/HDF5 reader left all sorts of resources open, eventually causing a runtime error (when labeling axes)</li>
            <li>.jyds didn't explicitly close script after loading, eventually causing a runtime error. (when labeling axes)<li>
            <li>3538094: leftover files can cause temp file download to fail. (No temp file may be used for more than an hour.)</li>
            <li>CDAWeb refresh would add components off the event thread, which could cause application to lock up.</li>
            <li>in reducex function, weights not properly when accumulating min and max.</li>
            <li>rte 1031526646: need to check for null in result from jTree.getSelectionPaths().</li>
            <li>remote jyds would be editable in the editor panel, even though it was pointed to a local copy in the cache.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cdaweb checks for variables that are improperly listed as "data" and not "support_data" by checking depend_0.</li>
            <li>fix 20 second delay in FTP downloads caused by recent changes that closed resources out-of-order</li>
            <li>rte 0808343081: null pointer exception from bookmarks (guessing at a fix)</li>
            <li>rte 1769726397: operations " " would cause RTE, now we trim before parsing</li>
            <li>rte 1882535572: cast exception in layout GUI, because non-components (Renderers) can be in the list</li>
            <li>multiple plots can be selected again by holding down control in the layout tab's layout GUI</li>
            <li>add "plot" button to file cache window, since I often hit okay when I meant right-click...plot</li>
            <li>orbitPlot is selectable in list of plots</li>
            <li>validRange override is properly loaded from vaps</li>
            <li>autoranging with colorScatter corrected, it was ignoring the z ranging.</li>
            <li>CDAWeb uses HTTP for file access instead of problemmatic FTP access</li>
            <li>bugfix: clean up code in CDAWeb where web transaction occurred on the event thread.</li>
            <li>clean up of FTP filesystem access, including setting timeout, properly handling cancel, and properly closing channels.</li>
            <li>3534309:  procedure shows bug in reset after make stack plot. </li>
            <li>rte 0066550323: don't show "local listing file (.listing) not found" when filesystem is offline.</li>
            <li>3516161: clear old binding between timerange and plot.context.</li>
            <li>3533882: reset of timerange when move plot caused by handler ignoring binding</li>
            <li>Jemmy testing showed that ScriptContext.waitUntilIdle() would not detect pending event from data set selector.</li>
            <li>Jemmy end-to-end testing at gui level.</li>
            <li>run button on script panel now uses a popup monitor instead of a monitor attached to the canvas.</li>
            <li>bugfix when remote http host is in accessible, runtime error prevented offline use.</li>
            <li>Profiling used to remove memory leaks.  Now all CDF quantities can be plotted in one session.</li>
            <li>jsamp jar (Cluster Final Archive) added to Eclipse build script</li>
            <li>check for fill in Ops.interpolate( rank2ds, xx, yy )</li>
            <li>Chris pointed out problem where ytagWidth is used from the first table of a rank 3 join dataset.  Now we use the maximum of all tables.</li>
            <li>$o and $(o properly detected in pngwalk tool</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.

            autoplot.org will run this version.
