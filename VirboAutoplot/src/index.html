        <p><small>Custom renderers allow for arbitrary data renderings.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>plot id changes are propogated through the rest of the vap.</li>
            <li>filenames with spaces would cause problems again.</li>
            <li>SemanticOps.isTableDataSet wouldn't count rank 2 table with rank 2 ytags as table.</li>
            <li>3611281: Clean up TSB requests when a set of plots shares a time axis.  This bug would cause excessive hits to the das2servers.</li>
            <li>Test100 and other tests work properly again</li>
            <li>3611375: waitUntilIdle properly counts an active editor as idle.</li>
            <lI>3611210: test002 occasionally hangs</li>
            <li>rte_0665049794: changes to improve handling of output from fftPower. </li>
            <li>rfe 3596086: CDF Java implementation now implements slice1 to save memory</li>
            <li>more corrections for Windows names like c:\foo\file.txt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve support for bins datasets for tags.  slice0 didn't properly handle this, or the display data slice.</li>
            <li>old NN and spectrogram routines didn't handle bins tags, seriously misrepresenting the data.</li>
            <li>autoplot_data/config/system.properties includes rangeChecking switch after bins datasets caused incorrect rendering of data.</li>
            <li>Java CDF reader improves support for slice1 by slicing as each block is read in.</li>
            <li>waitUntilIdle checks the event queue again for pending updates (test018 would fail occasionally)</li>
            <li>test100 (Jemmy GUI testing) and test037 (user scripts) are functional again.</li>
            <li>rte_0932474502: User arm at Iowa would get runtime errors about width=0 on SunOS.  </li>
            <li>3610169: JythonDataSources wouldn't reject if the timeseries was not specified, causing ranges to reset because it wouldn't adopt the axis range.</li>
            <li>Steve at Goddard pointed out that is nearly impossible to select multiple plots and swap two plots' positions on a mac without a mouse.</li>
            <li>Reload all data now resets Jython data source properly, which would cache the interpreter.</li>
            <li>excessive gaps in LSpec routine resolved by loosening intra-sweep cadence check.</li>
            <li>unrecognized errors from the Data Sources were only printed to the status bar.  Now we get a popup.</li>
            <li>jython getItem for QDataSet could fail if dataset was not writable.</li>
            <li>trimDataSet's trim operation wouldn't allow a trim(0,len) operation to work.</li>
            <li>jython invoke(name,PyObject args) did not properly wrap the function
            <li>bookmarks download timeout was in milliseconds instead of seconds, which caused RTE now that there is a 12 hour limit.</li>
            <li>initial coding of int8 transfer type in QStream had bug</li>
            <li>2987871: limit the number of records formatted to the log console BEFORE formatting them, not after</li>
            <li>fix problem where save vap before load vap would leave Craig in a strange folder</li>
            <li>Leonard pointed out case where CAA would return CDFs that didn't properly mark fill and would cause RTE.</li>
            <li>Reiner had RTE caused by URL having "user@" inserted automatically when authorization was needed</li>
            <li>Bugfix when output of rank 2 where was used to index dataset.</li>
            <li>Non-ascii check in ascii parser didn't account for tabs (ascii=9)</li>
            <li>trace function restored when developing jython scripts.</li>
            <li>3609543: downloadResourceAsTempFile cleanup policy changed to support multiple processes and Tomcat servers</li>

            <li>recent change broke BUNDLE in rank 3 datasets from CDF file.</li>
            <li>sprocess was called twice when exporting the processed data.</li>
            <li>3608830: disable export options that won't work.</li>
            <li>rte_1825469520: URL doesn't contain authority (http:///autoplot.org/)</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
