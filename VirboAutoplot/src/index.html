        <p><small>NetCDF and HDF5 files now have depend0 parameter so two variables can be connected without a script.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2016a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Experimental <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac Release</a> is available.
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2017-03-11 r20515):</p>
        <ul>   
            <li>1794: correction to branch when github is accessed.
            <li>some spectrogram and color scatter assumed data and colorbar zunits were the same.
            <li>https://bugs-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/mantis/view.php?id=478: ascii time transfer types could not have differing units.
            <li>test100 showed where an immutable dataset was modified with the "hanning" filter. 
            <li>&y=bgsm[:,1] was unnecessarily URL-encoded, reducing readability.</li>
            <li>where parameters list was incorrect when the HDF5 file contained structures
            <li>link(x,y,z) dropped z, when x y or z is an object (not dataset).
            <li>issue a warning when das2stream units change, which can cause problems.
            <li>where with HDF5 files containing parameters with dots in the name was never tested.
            <li>where with HDF5 files containing structures was never tested.
            <li>csv editor panel has selection for delimiter.
            <li>corrections to HAPI reader, which was broken after rank 2 DEPEND_1 support was added.
            <li>addDataPoint.jy script updated to use DataPointRecorder (not DataPointRecorderNew), and supports keystroke mode.
            <li>log "ImageIO used to create" at less than info, to avoid clutter in server logs.
            <li>rte_1490216564: don't throw runtime error when taskSize is zero, just ignore it.
            <li>1785: unable to format bundle to CDF.  (Append is now handled properly.)  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>1789: PngWalkTool correct feedback about writing to writable fs.  The code didn't distinguish between Read-Only and Read-Write, and assumed that local filesystems were read-write.  Thanks, Sebastian!
            <li>rte_0147649225: fall back after failing to find "field6" in bundleDescriptor, because HAPI metadata was mistaken for Rich ASCII.
            <li>rte 0857617456: Null pointer when selecting time field type but time format column has never been set.  Thanks, Shiva!
            <li>corrections to format to .wav gui, which wasn't initialized properly to indicate automatic scaling.

            <li>DownloadResourceAsTempFile never properly indicated progress, showing progress bar with incorrect position.
            <li>Script panel would ask if you want to reload script when time stamp changed, even if the contents did not change.
            <li>1754: explicitly close Network connections, and call System.gc while interacting with CDAWeb.
            <li>1754: cache metadata requests so that the metadata for a given file is only retrieved once every ten seconds.
            <li>1754: corrections to 301 redirects to support old URLs pointing to CDAWeb.
            <li>1754: Use https to access CDAWeb.  Java 1.8.0r102 is now required to access CDAWeb.

            <li>1769: make sure event things happen on the event thread DataPointRecorder
            <li>rte_1889988765: null pointer path in DataPointRecorder load
            <li>bug 1770, catch the NullPointerException and print it to stderr
            <li>clean up DataPointRecorder new so that it provides all the function of DataPointRecorderNew.
            <li>rte_0809841297: Sebastian noticed this harmless runtime exception, which occurs when the last guy listening to the service was closed.
            <li>don't warn about empty script editor which has been modified.
            <li>Some loggers were still logging at INFO, which shows up in web logs and could cause problems.
            <li>1765: properly handle carots in URIs.  Thanks Ivar!
            <li>1764: vap+inline GUI with events corrected, so that you can re-enter the GUI.
            <li>1749: GUI generated supports (kinda) positional parameters
            <li>1763: spectrogram codes should accept X,Y->Z (rank1 X,Y,Z).  Thanks Babtiste and Chris!
            <li>1762: add support for URL argument types.
            <li>1760: remove "here" from rebinning code, which would hang the Mac release with stdout noise.  Thanks, Sebastian!

            <li>1730: correct code for adding label when slice1=i is used.  Thanks, Tami!
            <li>file:///tmp/foo.zip/Chipmunks.wav wouldn't work because wav file wasn't accessed properly within the zip file.
            <li>check that processedData checkbox is enabled before setting it because originalData is not enabled.
            <li>1759: support rank2 DEPEND_2 in expressions like ds[r,:,:].  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>total supports rank 0 data.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>1566: improper escaping meant that pngwalk tool may not have been using thumbs400 directory.
            <li>rte_0064480313: index out of bounds in pngwalk tool when using limited range.  Thanks Laura!
            <li>improvements to Orbit mode, for example when the last point is fill.

            <li>rte_0579587635: single pipe character (|) in operations would cause RTE.  
            <li>Hapi client had a branch that would result in class cast exception RTE popup.
            <li>1750: ds[-1,r]=0 didn't work, where negative indeces weren't supported.  Thanks, Ivar!
