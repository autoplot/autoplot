        <p><small>New where parameter for CDF makes it easier to filter by mode.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2013b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <ul>
            <li>catch more RTEs in Jython Script panel when using completions.</li>
            <li>remove old code that would reset the timerange when switching das2servers.  This could break bindings.</li>
            <li>clean up of export to rich ascii</li>
            <li>hide confusing plot buttons on add bookmark popup</li>
            <li>log level are not set initially.  This was unnecessary and prevented use of logging.properties file</li>
            <li>rte 1171026816: George's RTE about RBSP-ECT file</li>
            <li>1140: bugfix in TSB where events where thrown out when application was locked, so data wouldn't load</li>
            <li>rte 1466756642: new code broke "View in Autoplot" button.  Thanks ksigsbee, balazs, dgcrawfo, and icohen</li>
            <li>1138: don't mistake "/c" for protocol in "/c:/"</li>
            <li>isConstant uses equivalent function now, instead of .equals.</li>
            <li>A CDF variable's DELTA_PLUS_VAR could point to itself, cause infinite recursion and crashing Java</li>
            <li>improve support for rank 2 energies, supporting ds[:,0:2,:] so DEPEND_2 is preserved.</li>
            <li>the delegate editor with aggregation could not remove parameters.</li>
            <li>DataSourceEditor browseSourceType handles plugins like script:... properly, avoiding runtime error.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit->Options copied to Options->Additional Options, Edit-Options will be removed after AGU.</li>
            <li>check rich ascii dep0 for colon splitting name from description</li>
            <li>1128: horizontal and vertical slices need to go away when data goes away</li>
            <li>1129: renderers can get out of sync with axes, fail to repaint</li>
            <li>1130: bugfix in java cdf, where outerProduct was used to replicate a non-varying record, replacing invalid measurements with fill value, so valid range could not be corrected.</li>
            <li>addTab is run on event thread, could cause deadlock</li>
            <li>reference in DataSource to QStream removed because it was not necessary and caused compile problems.</li>
            <li>clean up after vertical and horizontal spectrogram slicers when spectrogram is removed</li>
            <li>1095: Seth showed experimental handling of reference cache was causing problems.</li>
            <li>empty CDF files now trigger NoDataInIntervalException when a variable contains no records, rather than IllegalArgumentException, to support use in scripts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example thin client code allows arbitrary .vap to be used</li>
            <li>check for NetCDF/HDF magic number in CDF GUI</li>
            <li>Improve logging with new "gui" logger that will improve feedback for debugging</li>
            <li>length render shows equation of the line</li>
            <li>"Plot Below" button on horizontal slicer copies the data onto the canvas.</li>            
            <li>CDF data source allows &amp;where=mode.eq(1)</li>
            <li>slice1 allows slicing at a datum like "1000 eV"</li>
            <li>history dialog has .vap button for convenience and example filter.</li>
       </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>waveform data supported in the series renderer, allowing finer control.</li>
            <li>add DasPlot options for plot background color, grid color, etc</li>
            <li>properly signed jnlp application allows launching without excessive security dialogs</li>
            <li>Also, message bubble timeout preference introduced as well as displayLogLevel</li>
            <li>1093: printingLogLevel preference allows messages to be turned off when printing.</li>
            <li>Options panel replaced with custom GUI, old and redundant controls removed, explanations added</li>
            <li>introductory support for VOTables.</li>

        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
