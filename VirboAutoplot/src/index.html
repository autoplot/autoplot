    <H3>Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>

        <img alt="screenshot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>A bug is fixed with ISTP CDFs sent over OpenDap, allowing rank 2 data to be plotted.  The top panel is accessing the data directly in a CDF file, the bottom is via OpenDAP.</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>remote bookmarks file with remoteURL buried deep in the tree is handled properly.</li>
            <li>don't show the main GUI when "pngwalk:" is used.</li>
            <li>bookmarks with remote URLs load properly when "bookmarks:..." is used to bring in new bookmarks</li>
            <li>bugfixes to allow rank 2 CDF data (stereo/swaves) to be read over openDAP.</li>
            <li>hung event thread detector writes to autoplot_data/log when event thread appears to be hung.</li>
            <li>das2server is more flexible about handing times.</li>
            <li>downloadResourceAsTempFile long filename bug fixed by using hash for long filenames</li>
            <li>ISO8601 char arrays in NetCDF/HDF5 can now be up to 35 characters long.  Any variable with DEPEND_0 is considered to have ISTP conventions.</li>
            <li>New filesystem stuff wouldn't clean up locks when create failed. (Thanks Hudson!)</li>
            <li>Major fix to filesystem stuff, where a hung filesystem create doesn't prevent further use of any filesystems (and Autoplot)</li>
            <li>fixes to rich ascii, including unbundle preserves bundle with proper labels, and support for enums</li>
            <li>check for cache area when saving Jython files was broken.</li>
            <li>ZipFileSystem had a bug that prevented its use in some situations.</li>
            <li>Initial HEAD request in HTTPFileSystem changed to GET request to support LANL.</li>
            <li>bugfix in AutoHistogram when log check would produce a different length histogram</li>
            <li>pngwalk views all accept mouse wheel events properly</li>
            <li>"pngwalk:" initial URI works now</li>
            <li>in CDAWEB, CRRES_H0_MEA and UY_1MIN_VHM have 10-day spans now.</li>
            <li>bugfix: negative cadence handled in http://www.rssd.esa.int/saweb/swics/data/1999/19990107.cdf?MATRIX_RATE_1</li>
            <li>c:/documents and settings/ is a hidden link on Windows 7, which when used resulted in null pointer exception</li>
            <li>various cleanup in das2server plugin</li>
            <li>omni2_h0_mrg1hr_$Y$(m,span=6)$d_v01.cdf with $d instead of 01 works fine.</li>
            <li>null pointer exception in resetZoom[XYZ] when dataset had not been plotted</li>
            <li>Improvements to make aggregation GUI requested by Reiner.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the Feedback GUI to support use in firewalled environment that doesn't allow post.</li>
            <li>Minor corrections to data tab/slice area, including slice indexes is always enabled.  And focus dataset toString is displayed for reference.</li>
            <li>3487247: make sure remote bookmark is not editable, since edits would be lost once the remote are read in again.</li>
            <li>Jython ds[:,0] implemented with unbundle should have disallowed high-rank unbundle (which allows a rank 3 dataset to be stored in a rank 2 table.)</li>
            <li>DataSourceEditorDialog is always created on the event thread, avoiding occasional hang in JythonDataSource</li>
            <li>rte_0076363774_20120128_090924: sloppiness in the trim function of DDataSet </li>
            <li>In JythonDataSource, try to add the TSB capability immediately, so this behaves like a proper TSB-capable data source.</li>
            <li>Fixes to single-instance launch</li>
            <li>delay construction of axes and style tabs to work-around 1 sec delay in GUI on Mac.</li>
            <li>bugfixes in Bx|fftPower(512).  fftPower result is marked as a qube.</li>
            <li>weightsDataSet handles bundles.</li>
            <li>BUNDLE_1 should not be propogated through binaryOp and unaryOp.</li>
            <li>3116643: data sources with TimeSeriesBrowse, that have a URI without the timerange, are accepted by binding automatically to the application timerange.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3484946: A change in v2011a_7 caused datasets to fail to automatically bind to the application timerange.</li>
            <li>old code from original Autoplot was ignored render type guess code and set this based on monotonic property.</li>
            <li>3484940: guessCadenceNew would not tally deltas properly, resulting in incorrect cadence=0 for vap+inline:0,0,100,100,0,0;0,0,0,100,100,0</li>
            <li>link(x,y) shouldn't return a bundle dataset, it should return y(x).</li>
            <li>fftFilter threw out units.</li>
            <li>3482782: stress testing revealed some interesting memory leaks.  These are addressed.</li>
            <li>bugfixes in SeriesRenderer error bars and outline fillStyle when printing pointed out by Jon V.</li>
            <li>3198392: bookmarks update while user is in the menu would cause them to not update properly.  Now this is done on event thread.</li>
            <li>bugfix in cdf/java checking on variable lengths.  rank 2 data would indicate a length mismatch because of old code.</li>
            <li>ArrayDataSet trim didn't trim PLANE_0 property.  Now we use DataSetUtil.trimProperties for consistent behavior.</li>
        </ul>
