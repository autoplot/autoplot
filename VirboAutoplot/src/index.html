        <p><small>A rank 3 dataset is aggregated and sliced twice.</small></p>

	<p>This demonstration application attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Additional metadata can then 
be applied to the data, for example, specifying valid range and fill data.
	</p>
        
        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.            
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul><li> bugfixes:
<ul><li> aggregation with rank 3 datasets had lots of issues.
</li><li> multiple identical bindings would result in runtime exception when attempt to unbind
</li><li> 2793948: clean up of panels with child panels stuff (used for B-GSM for example, copy panels would fail)
<ul><li> copy panels would fail
</li><li> vap files were quirky at best
</li></ul>
</li><li> regression in panel focus fixed.  (move By to plot below would move Bx instead)

</li><li> bugfixes with rank 3 dataset slicing, vap files, autoranging.
</li><li> 2792481: docked canvas could only be so small and status bar would get clipped.  now axis panel and style panel have scrollbars.
</li><li> large ascii files with no valid records would hang up the reader during completion, now the header length is limited to 10000 lines.
</li><li> 2789036: tiny columns in ascii table fixed
</li><li> 2794977:File-&gt;"Reset Application" resets application to initial state.
</li><li> 2794972: "Edit Data Source" added to plot context menu.
</li></ul>
</li><li> minor features:
<ul><li> Ascii table reader gets new "tail" parameter

</li><li> script context gets "plot( panelNum, label, qdataset )" methods
</li><li> PyQDataSet is sequence by defining __len__, allowing ds[3] to slice a rank&gt;1 dataset.
</li><li> switch from spectrogram to series to spectrogram supported for rank 2 with small number of channels (<12).
</li><li> nearest neighbor spectrogram introduced to render types for convenience.
</li></ul>

<p>Known issues:</p>
<li> Applet suffers from same seven second delay, applet can show display
</li><li> bug: aggregation sometimes still jumps when you adjust the z-axis.  Demo 2.
</li><li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li><li> CDF depend_1 number of elements is incorrect.
</li><li> Unable to download vap:<a href="ftp://user:pass@mrfrench.lanl.gov/lanl/geo/cdf/H3_SOPA/LANL-97A/2007/LANL_LANL-97A_H3_SOPA_20070130_V01.cdf" class="external free" title="ftp://user:pass@mrfrench.lanl.gov/lanl/geo/cdf/H3_SOPA/LANL-97A/2007/LANL_LANL-97A_H3_SOPA_20070130_V01.cdf" rel="nofollow">ftp://user:pass@mrfrench.lanl.gov/lanl/geo/cdf/H3_SOPA/LANL-97A/2007/LANL_LANL-97A_H3_SOPA_20070130_V01.cdf</a>
</li><li> race condition with setSliceDimension and setFillDataSet results in "inconvertable units"
</li>

<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
