	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  Its feature set is finalized and will soon be the production branch.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>aggregation didn't allow wildcards like (.*) to be used, now it does.</li>
            <li>3395693: FTP filesystem caching assumed a static remote site, now new listings are made up to once every 20 seconds (as with http)</li>
            <li>Ops.interpolate preserves metadata</li>
            <li>fill not identified in Ops.magnitude</li>
            <li>Operations pipeline correctly handles metadata by dropping external metadata for unsupported functions.  Before we would just ignore them, so data and metadata would not match up.</li>
            <li>3436569: Double-slicing (Rank 4 to Rank 2, |slice2(0)|slice1(0)) would not be properly reported in Operations field</li>
            <li>3436922: in slicing of SpaceWeather(20,8,3) where changing the slice wouldn't reset properly</li>
            <li>3436911: in automatic slicing of vap+inline:ripples(20,8,3).  Adjusting slice index wouldn't adjust child slices.
            <li>bugfix label of in-line dataset in rich ASCII files</li>
            <li>Spectrogram render type correctly restored from vap file.  Before the renderType node would get close, but NoInterpolate mode would not work.</li>
            <li>3437327: two column csv without time location units wouldn't plot as it would have with the AsciiDataSource, now it does.</li>
            <li>3438527: getViewWindow() returns null after second is closed</li>
            <li>3439598: CDF variable with three channels having same name</li>
            <li>bugfixes with remote bookmarks, when remote folder contains other remote folders</li>
            <li>in applot.pro, check for NaN's before byteswap</li>
            <li>in IDL/Matlab bridge, error reporting is improved.</li>
            <li>logic for guessing timerange supports non-aggregating data sources, and guesses before entering GUI.</li>
            <li>expert/basic mode code accidentally turned overplot button back on in add plots GUI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bugfix loading rank 4 CDF files</li>
            <li>bugfix: CDAWeb all.xml correction handled.  <b>Earlier development releases will no longer work.</b></li>
            <li>bugfix: FTP shows credentials dialog when anonymous login fails with 530 exception.</li>
            <li>huge round of FindBugs bug fixes correct minor bugs (probably never observed) and cleans up code.</li>
            <li>bugfix: minor bugfixes of the CDAWeb GUI.</li>
            <li>bugfix: extraneous "(remote)" labels on remote folders</li>
            <li>clean up of bookmarks GUI</li>
            <li>pngwalk removed from basic mode, clean up separators</li>
            <li>round of findbugs to remove most offensive code</li>
            <li>from the autoplot 2010 production branch:
              <ul>
              <li>bugfix: minor internationalization problems (DigitalRenderer)</li>
              <li>bugfix: RTE reports are properly formatted XML</li>
              <li>forward compatibility with autoplot2011 bookmarks</li>
              <li>bugfix: RTE when CDAWeb panel is entered before anything else is plotted.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java Webstart supports "single instance", so relaunching will recycle running app instead of opening a second window</li>
            <li>rfe 3433860: Data operations can contain both component and process string, as in "Bx|histogram()"</li>
            <li>slices function introduced, to clarify high-rank slicing. |slices('',16,4) instead of |slice1(16)|slice1(4)</li>
            <li>Greek and Math symbols added to the font chooser dialog sample text</li>
            <li>TimeSeriesBrowse used to initialize GUIs.</li>
            <li>more findbugs cleanup of source code.</li>
            <li>python codes can convert strings like "10 nT" into datasets.  e.g. ds+'10 nT' works now.</li>
            <li>&lt;update check="background"&gt; should speed up launch a little more</li>
            <li>ask before quitting when "close" is pressed and this is the last panel</li>
            <li>popup menus for axis tab show macros like %{RANGE}</li>
            <li>processed data result (e.g. after slicing) is shown on metadata tab.  (Buggy)</li>
            <li>values in metadata tab are now the first twenty and last three values</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minor cleanup of timerange GUI.</li>
        </ul>

</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
        <ul>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
        </ul>
