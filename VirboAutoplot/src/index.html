        <p><small>Autoplot is used to extract the sound of individual fireworks.  In this application, data within mouse box selections are auralized and formatted into a wav file.</small></p>
        
	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li> bugfix 2818967: inconsistent handling of fill obs in ACE SIS
</li><li> introduce support for bundle datasets
</li><li> bugfix in QStream when packets are &gt;10000KB.
</li><li> introduce lightweight bindings to improve startup time
</li><li> tweaks to png walk tool, such as sorting filenames and spacing in coverflow.
</li><li> png walk tool reflections were released in last version.
</li><li> das2 Auralizer fixed. (see VirboAutoplot/src/scripts/auralizeTool.py)
</li><li> jython completions improved by setting symbols "resourceURI" and "dom".  Automatic data source update removed as other mechanisms can provide this functionality.
</li></ul>
<p>
        
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> Applet suffers from same seven second delay, applet can show display
</li><li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
