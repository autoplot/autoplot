        <p><small>New options panel explains what options are, and removes redundant and obsolete controls.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2013b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <ul>
            <li>Edit->Options copied to Options->Additional Options, Edit-Options will be removed after AGU.</li>
            <li>check rich ascii dep0 for colon splitting name from description</li>
            <li>1128: horizontal and vertical slices need to go away when data goes away</li>
            <li>1129: renderers can get out of sync with axes, fail to repaint</li>
            <li>1130: bugfix in java cdf, where outerProduct was used to replicate a non-varying record, replacing invalid measurements with fill value, so valid range could not be corrected.</li>
            <li>addTab is run on event thread, could cause deadlock</li>
            <li>reference in DataSource to QStream removed because it was not necessary and caused compile problems.</li>
            <li>clean up after vertical and horizontal spectrogram slicers when spectrogram is removed</li>
            <li>1095: Seth showed experimental handling of reference cache was causing problems.</li>
            <li>empty CDF files now trigger NoDataInIntervalException when a variable contains no records, rather than IllegalArgumentException, to support use in scripts.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>1124: reproducible deadlock on mac when printing to PDF</li>
            <li>export bundle to qds now uses specialized formatter for efficient output.  Before it would have to use the same encoding for all datasets.</li>
            <li>Horizontal slice works again with spectrograms with rank 2 Y and some records containing all fill, thanks Joe!</li>
            <li>UVI images were mistaken for waveform data, thanks Len!</li>

            <li>1112: poor adapt of legacy TableDataSet from das2server</li>
            <li>1111: AutoplotDataServer looks for $H in granules, switches to process by hour.</li>
            <li>1104: new cache problems, in-memory cache limited to 5 seconds.</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
