	<p>This demonstration application attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Additional metadata can then 
be applied to the data, for example, specifying valid range and fill data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.            
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul><li>more bugfixes
</li><li> uint,truncatedFloat support in BinaryDataSource
</li>
</ul>
<p>Known Bugs:
</p>
<ul><li> 2781154  	 guessCadence isn't invoked on vap load
</li><li> 2781151  	 panel selection as plot focus is changed
</li><li> 2769881 delete parent panel, then switch to spectrogram
</li><li> 2769879 export data needs to remember last output
</li><li> 2712135 FileSystemCompletions needs to account for wildcards
</li><li> 2702937 dataset URI in selector needs to update with panel focus
</li><li> 2771492 spaces in Windows filenames causing problems again
</li></ul>


<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
