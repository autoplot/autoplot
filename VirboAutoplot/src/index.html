        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2015a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.  Java 7 will be required in May!
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Bugfixes (2015-02-16 r16276):</p>
        <ul>    
            <li>1341: CDF subsample was terribly slow, because subsampling/5M record file.  Now just read in all the data, then subsample.  Thanks Kristoff!</li>
            <li>pngwalk generation would fail when years were 2008-2014, because it was counting off in 365-day, not yearly increments.</li>
            <li>add Ops.datum after seeing that dataset('2011-06-08T01:54') would parse but datum('2011-06-08T01:54') would not.</li>
            <li>1339:  LANL rank 4 cdf file shows that DataSetWrapper rank 4 was never implemented.  Thanks Brian!</li>
            <li>createPngWalk code used to assume vap argument was local reference, which needn't be the case.  This may cause problems on Windows.</li>
            <li>set the initial timerange to avoid extraneous load.  Thanks Reiner!</li>
            <li>initially set it to slices0(:) GUI correctly.</li>
            <li>1334: first image of pngwalk would be loaded at the full resolution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>look up wwwauthenticate in HTTP header information to make the dialog more like webstart auth dialog.</li>
            <li>1332: autoplot.jnlp would drop the URI when multiple jnlp blocks were found in the jnlp file, even if the first was commented</li>
            <li>bugfix: log message assumed that data was rank 0 in the TCA code, causing failure.</li>
            <li>bugfix: "show in Autoplot" button would now raise the window immediately to show that action has occurred, and progress bars are visible</li>
            <li>support http://autoplot.org/autoplot.jnlp?version=devel&amp;URI kludge, so that references to this version can be used.</li>
            <li>1331: autorange failure with cdfTT2000 timetags for waveform data on 2014-02-01.  Thanks Patrice for pointing out this bug!</li>
            <li>1330: qds supports aggregation of two time intervals.</li>
            <li>Demo1 then Demo2 showed where DEFAULT_TIME (2010-01-01) was used as an option.</li>
            <li>look for AUTOPLOT_DATA/config/logging.properties.</li>
            <li>bug 1327:  blur URI causes das2server to loose resolution.</li>
            <li>correct misspelling/typo of addCapability after years without noticing.  Yeah code completion!</li>
            <li>getDataSet menu option completion now correctly checks for var= to see if the user has already corrected the name.</li>
            <li>1326: aggregations are no longer guarenteed monotonic.  See ensureMonotonic to correct.</li>
            <li>allow vap+qds:/tmp/foo.dqt to work.  Before it was using the extension.</li>
            <li>bugfix: support eventsListUri in vap file.</li>
            <li>1326: new aggregation monotonic rule causes too many problems.  Initial code to just sort the data.</li>
            <li>das2stream reader detects when a qstream is input.</li>
            <li>Events List tool handles exceptions properly.</li>
            <li>1321: improvements to the IDL bridge, after trying to read 5M points of magnetometer data.  Thanks, Kris!</li>
            <li>1321: IDL bridge preserves TT2000 longs. </li>
            <li>1322: aggregation supports NIO BufferDataSets that come out of the CDF reader. (Whoops!)</li>
            <li>1323: "no valid y tags" message caused by fill in DELTA_PLUS when DELTA_PLUS wasn't really needed.  Thanks, Seth!</li>
            <li>1317: result of fftPower hints that log scale type should be used.</li>
            <li>1315: keep track of das2server key so the user is prompted just once per session.</li>
            <li>turn on word wrap in runtime error submit form.</li>
            <li>Thin client support finally catches errors instead of leaving the progress wheel spinning.</li>
            <li>corrections to FiltersEditorPanel, such as allowing for float arguments and medianFilter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ticks can be set manually from scripts.</li>
            <li>console GUI can export records as XML or flat ascii file now</li>
            <li>Autoplot servlet supports backgroundColor=none for transparent backgrounds</li>
            <li>pngwalk create speed is reported in images per minute instead of .1/sec</li>
            <li>add fftPower that matches the filter call.</li>
            <li>javadoc improvements to DasCore</li>
       </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>           
            <li>updates to the jnlp/webstart, supporting better offline use and named icons.</li>
            <li>add Jython formUri to provide a nicer way to construct URIs.</li>
            <li>411: add hook to check for logging.properties to make it easier to debug webstart. </li>
            <li>.pngwalk files now have a baseurl parameter so that they can be used out-of-context.</li>
            <li>add |getProperty('DEPEND_1') filter so I can easily have a look at timetags.</li>
            <li>BufferDataSet, which uses native-memory-backed-buffers, moved from BinaryDataSource to QDataSet</li>
            <li>allow aggregation reduce to be used when resolution is null, because trim will still have an effect.</li>
            <li>SimpleServlet will figure out if URI is a vap file, to support the thin client and to match the Autoplot interface.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
