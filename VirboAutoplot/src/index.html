        <p><small>axis popup menu allows the units to be changed.  Here we switch from a unit that supports the leap second (cdfTT2000).
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2015a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Bugfixes (2015-09-22 r17510):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Export to CDF didn't properly support append keyword.</li>
            <li>HugeScatter wouldn't to paint the exception if that's why it didn't have a dataset</li>
            <li>vap+inline each line needs to be URL-decoded.  Add monitor so downloadResourceAsTempFile can be used.</li>
            <li>if the first filter was an implicit unbundle, then it Filters GUI wouldn't update properly</li>
            <li>FFTPower GUI supports slide of 8 (7/8 overlap)</li>

            <li>1458: valid function would return result with fill_value of its input for reference, but this could be zero, which is incorrect. SUGGEST_FILL property added.</li>
