        <p><small>Dataset scheme for representing X,Y,Z buckshot data is supported in the SeriesRenderer.  The page http://autoplot.org/Cooking_at_LANL shows how to make this plot.</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3469219: handle units in append.  For example LANL has files where timetags are always from start of day</li>
            <li>bugfix: Turns out "ms since 1992-09-13T00:00" in a QStream would not be interpreted as a time.  Now SemanticOps.lookupUnits is used.</li>
            <li>bugfix: rank3 copyValues IDL/Matlab adapter failed because the length(i0) was used instead of length(i0,i1), leaving result mostly zeroes.</li>
            <li>bugfix: migrate changes from the CDF Java library to support the same virtual variables</li>
            <li>3469880: tooltips should go on field labels, not on the label itself. </li>
            <li>bugfix: getParam( 'timerange', '1997-Jan' ) wouldn't support TimeSeriesBrowse because "Jan" was not [a-z]*</li>
            <li>updates to auralizeTool so that it works again</li>
            <li>clean up aggregate GUI, so previews are shown and one code is used to form aggregations</li>
            <li>bugfix: extra messages "autolayout was set to false" because all prefs were read just to get NN</li>
            <li>profiling to find problem spots for long batch runs</li>
            <li>3471016: move more GUI operations to event thread to avoid deadlocks</li>
            <li>ytagsDataSet gave Y[X] -> indgen() instead of Y.</li>
            <li>bugfix: digital renderer color was not bound to foreground color.</li>
            <li>bugfix: rank 2 [:,[X,Y,Z]] scheme supported in SeriesRenderer.</li>
            <li>update contour function to return bundle [:,[X,Y,Z]]</li>
            <li>bugfix: python supports ds[:,0] as unbundle, before it would drop metadata making it useless for bundles</li>
            <li>bugfix: in plotx, allow symbol='stars' by loosing up code that looks for values in enumeration</li>
            <li>bugfix: guard against ordinal units getting into axis setting.<li>
            <li>bugfix: rank 4 was never coded for TrimStrideWrapper.java, so python ds[:,:,:,4:6] would fail, clean up to today's qdataset</li>
            <li>bugfix: python supports ds[:,0] as shorthand for unbundle, before it would drop metadata making it useless for bundles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bugfix: qstreams would not look up time location units like "ms since 1992-09-20T00:00:00.000Z"</li>
            <li>3237397: gaps in das2 spectrograms</li>
            <li>3469219: handle units in append.  Before we would assume the units were unchanging and wouldn't check for this.</li>
            <li>bugfix: UNITS were set in Jython applyBinaryOp, when the caller should set the units.  This would result in "200 s" / "10 s" = "20 s"</li>
            <li>bugfixes with CDF reader metadata with high-rank CDF files.</li>
            <li>bugfix: where didn't check for fill data, and eq returns fill.</li>
            <li>bugfix: improvements to NN rendering, where single points were not enlarged</li>
            <li>bugfix: old kludge for dimensionless values in vap files removed to fix pitch angle distributions</li>
            <li>bugfix: pitch angle distribution renderer was flipped left-to-right!  This is still young code.  Please let us know if you were affected!</li>
            <li>bugfix: bottom plot can provide context for top plot when connector is used.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>guessNameFor(URI) introduced, and Jython script getDataSet completion attempts to suggest better name than "ds"</li>
            <li>add fftPowerDelta1024 to CDF virtual variable functions</li>
            <li>improve support for filesystem completions like .../1wire/dot4_data/$Y/$m/$d/10.&lt;COMP&gt;</li>
            <li>LSpec code updated to work with today's Autoplot, and included in single-jar release</li>
            <li>NetCDF/HDF5 reader supports constraints like ds[0:10] to allow read of huge files.</li>
            <li>box zoom detected and described efficiently in undo list</li>
            <li>add  Ops.flatten function, before we had only flattenRank2</li>
            <li>introduce SemanticOps.getLooseUnitsConverter, which allows a ratiometric unit to be compared to a dimensionless. (2 kg).gt(1) </li>
            <li>simplify code and allow ds[r] to be used where ds is rank 2 and r is rank 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add mkdir function to ScriptContext.</li>
            <li>getDataSet completion in Jython editor guesses default name from URI instead of "ds"</li>
            <li>support ISTP metadata in NC and HDF5 files for LANL</li>
            <li>automatically treat -1e99 as fill in NC and HDF5 files.</li>
            <li>handle ISO8601 formatted times in HDF5 and NC files.  The CDF folks and LANL were both producing files like this.</li>
            <li>add icon for events renderer</li>
            <li>writeToPng and writeToPdf in scripts will now make the directory if it doesn't exist.</li>
        </ul>

<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>
