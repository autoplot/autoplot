        <p><small>Two You-Tube performances of music piece are compared using FFTPower.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2016a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available.
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2017-04-04 r20643):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>special handling of parseDecimal("NaN").
            <li>improve handling of space and umlaut (&uml;) in pngwalk file names.
            <li>rte_0746124665: George saw path that was resulted in NullPointerException.
            <li>one-arg join(ds) was deleted at some point, and is now replaced.  Thanks, George!
            <li>HAPI export supports rank 3.
            <li>bundle(ds1,ds2) correctly handles DEPEND_1 and DEPEND_2 when bundled datasets have equivalent values.
            <li>correction to ascii formatting when microsecond resolution is used.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>slice2 and slice3 preserve NAME property.
            <li>bugfix: LocalFileObject write capability didn't check to see if it could create a file, with the QC stuff in PNGWalk.
            <li>1804: trim off-by-one error corrected.
            <li>1802: checkIsotropic could trigger before axes were sized with AutoplotServer.
            <li>Java 8 Javadocs supported in Jython completions.
            <li>new CDF Jar file fixes problem where unused ThreadGroups were made.
            <li>1801: dataset iterator is inordinately slow, put in optimal loops for rank 1 data.  
            <li>interpolate and interpolateNN now have single-dataset interface as well as arrays.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>BufferDataSet remove redundant check of reclen which was also miscoded, using remaining() instead of limit(), producing incorrect warnings.
            <li>tca can be reset before entering the editor panel.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li>when bins are specified with ranges, use render type hint to request Nearest Neighbor Spectrograms.
            <li>bugfix: in the case where the HAPI dataset is just one day, the discovery range would be the day before the data range, making it a poor choice.
            <li>PDS/PPI uses https now.  Editor properly sets the parameter when returning to the editor GUI.
            <li>downloadResourceAsTempFile now includes http or https (or ftp) in generated filename.
            <li>getConvertibleUnits replaces getConvertableUnits (spelling error), and getConvertibleUnits now sorts the units.
            <li>trimStrideWrapper dropped metadata.
            <li>Units.getAllUnits would return a list of strings when it's declaration indicated that it would return a list of Units.  Thanks, Jon!
            <li>RTE reports (and provide feedback) must now submit to jfaden.net:80, not jfaden.net:8080, because of firewall issues.
            <li>1794: correction to branch when github is accessed.
            <li>some spectrogram and color scatter assumed data and colorbar zunits were the same.
            <li>https://bugs-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/mantis/view.php?id=478: ascii time transfer types could not have differing units.
            <li>test100 showed where an immutable dataset was modified with the "hanning" filter. 
            <li>&y=bgsm[:,1] was unnecessarily URL-encoded, reducing readability.</li>
            <li>where parameters list was incorrect when the HDF5 file contained structures
            <li>link(x,y,z) dropped z, when x y or z is an object (not dataset).
            <li>issue a warning when das2stream units change, which can cause problems.
            <li>where with HDF5 files containing parameters with dots in the name was never tested.
            <li>where with HDF5 files containing structures was never tested.
            <li>csv editor panel has selection for delimiter.
            <li>corrections to HAPI reader, which was broken after rank 2 DEPEND_1 support was added.
            <li>addDataPoint.jy script updated to use DataPointRecorder (not DataPointRecorderNew), and supports keystroke mode.
            <li>log "ImageIO used to create" at less than info, to avoid clutter in server logs.
            <li>rte_1490216564: don't throw runtime error when taskSize is zero, just ignore it.
            <li>1785: unable to format bundle to CDF.  (Append is now handled properly.)  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>1789: PngWalkTool correct feedback about writing to writable fs.  The code didn't distinguish between Read-Only and Read-Write, and assumed that local filesystems were read-write.  Thanks, Sebastian!
            <li>rte_0147649225: fall back after failing to find "field6" in bundleDescriptor, because HAPI metadata was mistaken for Rich ASCII.
            <li>rte 0857617456: Null pointer when selecting time field type but time format column has never been set.  Thanks, Shiva!
            <li>corrections to format to .wav gui, which wasn't initialized properly to indicate automatic scaling.
            <li>digitizer DataPointRecorder "new" operation fires dataset update event.  Thanks, Kris!

            <li>Experimental support for rank 2 DEPEND_1 datasets with HAPI.  HAPI uses sampleStartDate for discovery.
            <li>check for vap+internal:data_1,data_2 when switching to mash-up
            <li>1754: Correctly support http://autoplot.org/data/AMSR_E_L3_SeaIce6km_B06_20070307.hdf.gz

            <li>rte_0064480313: index out of bounds in pngwalk tool when using limited range.  Thanks Laura!
            <li>improvements to Orbit mode, for example when the last point is fill.

            <li>1753: datum/dataset now results in correct units.
            <li>1752: renderControl property needed to be handled after the style node when loading a file, so orbit plot settings would load properly

            <li>1749: correct code that handles unnamed command-line arguments for scripts, which dropped the first argument.
            <li>spectrogram code assumed there were valid Y tags.  Thanks, Seth!
            <li>rte_0579587635: single pipe character (|) in operations would cause RTE.  
            <li>Hapi client had a branch that would result in class cast exception RTE popup.
