        <p><small>Orbit plots are introduced into Autoplot.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul><li>CDFLeapSeconds.txt, file was never embedded in the jar files.</li>
            <li>Jython resourceURI can point at HTML file.  Before the new warning would pop up.</li>
            <li>allow fractional days in getTimeDatum(Y,m,d,H,M,S,N) function</li>
            <li>URI drop target moved to allow Applet to compile again.</li>
            <li>cleanup with das2 server and TCA labeling<li>
            <li>findex function allows repeat values in monotonic dataset.</li>
            <li>FileStorageModel wouldn't return representative file from $Y/$Y$m$d.dat if the last $Y was empty.</li>
            <li>TCA axis annotations are loaded asynchronously.  Before they were loaded on the event thread.</li>
            <li>Das2Server TCA labels corrected, they were not reported properly.</li>
            <li>code in TCAs assumed rank 0, causing failure of some TCAs to load.</li>
            <li>All children of off-line HTTP folder are automatically off-line.  Before, each would have to time out.</li>
            <li>recent timeranges and operations corrected.  After 20 entries, history would cause textfield to clear.</li>
            <li>delay construction of JColorChooser in color selector, on a Mac this could take 500ms!</li>
            <li>we need to trim preceeding _ and 0's in orbit names, to support orbit-based PNGWalks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cdfjava didn't properly indicate that DEPEND_2 pointed to non-existent variable, don't show error when LABL is found.</li>
            <li>cdf files are opened in prepare method so that exceptions are better reported.</li>
            <li>show progress monitor during download of master files.</li>
            <li>limit the number of pngs in a sequence to 20,000.</li>
            <li>GUI clean up of Manage Cache and Recent URIs dialogs.</li>
            <li>TimeRange Selector indicates if no one is listening</li>
            <li>reorder File menu so open .vap and open Data are next to each other</li>
            <li>Script and Log Consoles are properly hidden in basic mode.</li>
            <li>TimeRange Selector doesn't reset to valid when parse error occurs.</li>
            <li>Script and Log Consoles can be turned off and back on within a session.</li>
            <li>GUI clean up of pngwalk tool, including wait icons</li>
            <li>correct pngwalk tool hangs on Bob's folder with thousands of files because of excessive parsing of .listing file.</li>
            <li>correct pngwalk tool hangs caused by out of memory error due to excessive caching of full-size images.</li>
            <li>finally disable script panel and log console are immediate and can be re-enabled.</li>
            <li>allow spaces in timerange argument params like "$(o, id=crres)"</li>
            <li>limit the number of parent files listed when resolving ftp://virbo.org/POES/n15/$Y/poes_n15_$Y$m$d.cdf.zip/poes_n15_$Y$m$d.cdf?P1_90&timerange=1998-07-01</li>
            <li>remote zip files on Windows would not work because of c:\</li>
            <li>exceptions from data source are indicated in a more obvious way.</li>
            <li>more cleanup of bookmarks, limit the remote loading to once per session.</li>
            <li>remote bookmarks are all read at once, instead of in deeper and deeper depths</li>
            <li>remote-remote bookmarks show properly when off-line.</li>
            <li>remote folder in remote folder could be deleted.</li>
            <li>do a little rounding when automatically setting the timerange to avoid excessive resolution.</li>
            <li>any URI ending in slash would trigger filesystem completions.  Now we break it apart first.</li>
            <li>aggregation source does not fail if timerange is not set, since the TSB might be used to set it.</li>
            <li>3522211: FTP file locking error with FtpFileSystem on Windows.  Feedback of the error is corrected reported to the user.</li>
            <li>minor cleanup of CDAWeb GUI, such as sorting recent datasources.  And failure to update when a source is selected twice.</li>
            <li>Datum to Rank0DataSet converter handles fill</li>
            <li>minimum sizes set properly in PNGWalk tool so that tearing off and shrinking won't result in errors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Features:</p>

            <li>check parameters in time range specs, for example $(H,M) is now an exception.</li>
            <li>timerange selector uses droplist to allow selection of recently-entered timeranges</li>
            <li>likewise, operations selector keeps track of recent operations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=199733&atid=970682">see Source Forge</a>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    </ul>
