        <p><small>A Polar/Hydra spectrogram is sliced at two points in time.  Data can now be loaded once, and
                panels can display different slices of the data.  A new "Data" panel simplifies the axis panel
                and specifies data operations (such as slice or histogram) before display.
            </small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bugfixes in loading and saving vaps, resolved by adding autoComponent, autoRenderType, autoBinding properties</li>
    <li>bugfix with interaction of TimeSeriesBrowse and |slice0(0) component.
    <li>Bugfix where time range binding would be deleted in vap load and sync to.</li>
    <li>improvements to autoranging, to support CEPPAD archive</li>
    <li>Experimental collapse1 operator for component.</li>
    <li>Introduce Tools menu that includes PngWalk launcher and Make PNG Script launcher.</li>
    <li>Experimental: Tools menu discovers scripts in HOME/autoplot_data/tools.  This will probably
        become a set of bookmarks and the bookmarks manager will allow for managing tools.</li>
    <li>Bookmarks and recent items in PNG Walk Tool.</li>
    
</ul>
<p>


<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
