        <p><small>A year one bug where the context overview would mess up the menus is finally fixed.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2015a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.  Java 7 will be required in May!  Java 8 will be required
            sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Bugfixes (2015-05-01 r16778):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1383: double slash in history on Windows</li>
            <li>1387: vertical slicer should keep labels</li>
            <li>context overview doesn't mess up the menus like it has done since 2008.</li>
            <li>1385: VOTables contained lower case tr tags, where the parser assumed they would be upper case.</li>
            <li>1381: rebin propagates the labels and units.</li>
            <li>1380: correct the number of bins reported when DEPEND_2 is rank 2</li>
            <li>bugfix: correct place where blurTsbURI can return null.</li>
            <li>1377: corrections and clarifications with inline editor panel and URIs.</li>
            <li>1376: RTE caused by inline URI very hard to diagnose in script.</li>
            <li>QStreams with just one rank 2 dataset would flatten the QDataSet to rank 1 mistakenly.</li>

            <li>slice filter editor panel shouldn't use commas in the index.</li>
            <li>1375: operations GUIs are incorrectly set as focus is switched. </li>
            <li>remove long operations from the droplist of recent operations.  They mess up the layout of the GUI, and are probably difficult to interpret anyway.</li>

            <li>switch to latest version of Java CDF library</li>
            <li>Autoplot server only accepts connections from localhost, and doesn't allow imports.</li>

            <li>1366 DasProgressPanel constructor should be protected.  Jython scripts would sometimes not have a showing progress bar</li>
            <li>aggregation of two QStreams would fail because of change to when join datasets are flattened.</li>
            <li>1362: memory leaks shown by Kenzie's FFT process.</li>

            <li>clarify smax&lt;smin message in eventsRenderer</li>
            <li>bugfix when very small times were used and seconds was 0. with parse and format times.</li>
            <li>correct where $(subseconds,places=6) was ignoring the fractional part of the seconds field, and was just using the micros.</li>
            <li>1359: trim() supports waveform dataset, which was causing scan to next to fail.</li>
            <li>unsigned bytes, shorts and ints in HDF5 files are corrected.</li>
            <li>minor performance enhancements for huge scatter renderer</li>
            <li>1357: avoid nasty messages about immutable datasets, where CDAWeb plugin was modifying data that will soon be immutable.</li>
            <li>1356: clean up code where the listener would add another listener.</li>
            <li>1355: old renderer would paint new dataset, which could hang the event thread</li>
            <li>1353: corrections to huge scatter where large waveform packets were preventing it from painting individual points.</li>
            <li>1354: edit style properties now brings up custom editor.</li>
            <li>bugfix: single-tag dataset for ephemeris would result in RTE.</li>
            <li>HtmlTableDataSource name changes, improved support for dates.</li>
            <li>huge scatter properly implements flipped</li>
            <li>magic number check on CDF files would fail with old CDF files</li>
            <li>IndexGenDataSet is now final, more operations try to preserve internal types to save memory.</li>
            <li>CDF file units can now contain LaTeX code as well.</li>
            <li>1350: Corrections to QStreams containing bundles.</li>
            <li>rte 2071287514: cancel dialog by closing window caused RTE.  Check for other places where it is assumed at least one element is returned.  Thanks Bob!</li>

            <li>within function would incorrectly perform where command, when result should have been zeros and non-zeros.  This will affect scripts that use this command.</li>
            <li>clean up javadoc for ArrayDataSet.  Make ArrayDataSet implementations consistent with one another.</li>
            <li>introduce org.virbo.dataset.examples.Schemes.java, so that javadoc can refer to it.</li>

            <li>pngwalk generation would fail when years were 2008-2014, because it was counting off in 365-day, not yearly increments.</li>
            <li>add Ops.datum after seeing that dataset('2011-06-08T01:54') would parse but datum('2011-06-08T01:54') would not.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
