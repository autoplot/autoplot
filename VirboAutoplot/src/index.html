        <p><small>Jemmy Automated GUI Testing found a bug that was introduced just a day ago.  It will run through http://autoplot.org/developer.tests</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cdaweb checks for variables that are improperly listed as "data" and not "support_data" by checking depend_0.</li>
            <li>fix 20 second delay in FTP downloads caused by recent changes that closed resources out-of-order</li>
            <li>rte 0808343081: null pointer exception from bookmarks (guessing at a fix)</li>
            <li>rte 1769726397: operations " " would cause RTE, now we trim before parsing</li>
            <li>rte 1882535572: cast exception in layout GUI, because non-components (Renderers) can be in the list</li>
            <li>multiple plots can be selected again by holding down control in the layout tab's layout GUI</li>
            <li>add "plot" button to file cache window, since I often hit okay when I meant right-click...plot</li>
            <li>orbitPlot is selectable in list of plots</li>
            <li>validRange override is properly loaded from vaps</li>
            <li>autoranging with colorScatter corrected, it was ignoring the z ranging.</li>
            <li>CDAWeb uses HTTP for file access instead of problemmatic FTP access</li>
            <li>bugfix: clean up code in CDAWeb where web transaction occurred on the event thread.</li>
            <li>clean up of FTP filesystem access, including setting timeout, properly handling cancel, and properly closing channels.</li>
            <li>3534309:  procedure shows bug in reset after make stack plot. </li>
            <li>rte 0066550323: don't show "local listing file (.listing) not found" when filesystem is offline.</li>
            <li>3516161: clear old binding between timerange and plot.context.</li>
            <li>3533882: reset of timerange when move plot caused by handler ignoring binding</li>
            <li>Jemmy testing showed that ScriptContext.waitUntilIdle() would not detect pending event from data set selector.</li>
            <li>Jemmy end-to-end testing at gui level.</li>
            <li>run button on script panel now uses a popup monitor instead of a monitor attached to the canvas.</li>
            <li>bugfix when remote http host is in accessible, runtime error prevented offline use.</li>
            <li>Profiling used to remove memory leaks.  Now all CDF quantities can be plotted in one session.</li>
            <li>jsamp jar (Cluster Final Archive) added to Eclipse build script</li>
            <li>check for fill in Ops.interpolate( rank2ds, xx, yy )</li>
            <li>Chris pointed out problem where ytagWidth is used from the first table of a rank 3 join dataset.  Now we use the maximum of all tables.</li>
            <li>$o and $(o properly detected in pngwalk tool</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>match Nand's CDF library logic where getEffectiveRank skips over 1-element dimensions.  vap+cdaweb:ds=C1_CP_FGM_SPIN&id=B_vec_xyz_gse__C1_CP_FGM_SPIN&timerange=2011-03-02</li>
            <li>non-varying dimensions were assumed to be the trailing dimension.  vap+cdfj:ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/istp/canopus/asi/1999/cn_k0_asi_19991230_v01.cdf?Image</li>
            <li>PNGWalk Covers and Grid didn't update when the Quality status changed.</li>

            <li>CDFLeapSeconds.txt, file was never embedded in the jar files.</li>
            <li>Jython resourceURI can point at HTML file.  Before the new warning would pop up.</li>
            <li>allow fractional days in getTimeDatum(Y,m,d,H,M,S,N) function</li>
            <li>URI drop target moved to allow Applet to compile again.</li>

            <li>FileStorageModel wouldn't return representative file from $Y/$Y$m$d.dat if the last $Y was empty.</li>
            <li>TCA axis annotations are loaded asynchronously.  Before they were loaded on the event thread.</li>
            <li>Das2Server TCA labels corrected, they were not reported properly.</li>
            <li>code in TCAs assumed rank 0, causing failure of some TCAs to load.</li>
            <li>All children of off-line HTTP folder are automatically off-line.  Before, each would have to time out.</li>
            <li>recent timeranges and operations corrected.  After 20 entries, history would cause textfield to clear.</li>
            <li>delay construction of JColorChooser in color selector, on a Mac this could take 500ms!</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
