        <p><small>multiple events are now shown when there are overlaps.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add logging to aggregation to figure out why Dan's seeing inconsistent behavior</li>
            <li>local paths with /tmp in the path would fail.</li>
            <li>hugeScatter repaints properly, finally...</li>
            <li>cdf-java attempts to read to memory outside JVM, then falls back to JVM memory</li>
            <li>3586029: progress monitor cancel enabled for setTaskSize 1 of 3 (CDAWeb)</li>
            <li>rte_0818219940: null pointing when editing bookmarks</li>
            <li>3586030: one record of waveform data didn't autorange properly</li>
            <li>polar_fnl_ceppad-HISTe-lsort-l3_19970101_v1.0.0.cdf shows null pointer because failed to check for dimSizes=null</li>
            <li>3586034: multiple monitors on some Windows 7 locks up.  (Possible fix)</li>
            <li>validate data as it is read into aggregations to improve feedback</li>
            <li>George's problem where aggregation didn't work because of bug with reading 1-record CDFs</li>
            <li>shrink-vap-to-fit now scales fonts (and ems for layout) as well.</li>
            <li>3585373: CDF Java fails immediately with out of memory.  First attempt outside-JVM memory, then fall back to within JVM</li>
            <li>first progress indicator for loading in Ephemeris</li>
            <li>hugeScatter handles incorrect units like the scatter mode, putting up warning but plotting data anyway.</li>
            <li>TCAs (Emphemeris) in vap files are handled properly, so the date label is turned of when load a vap with emphemeris</li>
            <li>time range editor doesn't forget orbit number</li>
            <li>jython editor scroll increment set properly when editor has lots of arguments.</li>
            <li>sparse variables in Native CDF supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rte_0686841638: [] in qstream comments are now okay</li>
            <li>rte_0018238427: URI is not absolute, when exporting on Windows</li>
            <li>Messenger CDF variable uses sparse records.  Implement sparse records for native library, Java needs work.</li>
            <li>pngwalk tool supports .pngwalk files from within the tool, before they wouldn't show up in completions.</li>
            <li>.pngwalk files work properly when versioning is used.</li>
            <li>singleInstanceListener detects "pngwalk:" and does this automatically in a new pngwalk.</li>
            <li>in aggregation dialog, use a JTextField so long URIs don't mess up the GUI.</li>
            <li>tweak menu labels in the file menu</li>
            <li>fix one place in CDF codes where FUNCTION wasn't support were FUNCT was.  FUNCT is the new word.</li>
            <li>IndexOutOfBounds RTE in Pngwalk filmstrip view</li>
            <li>Jython negative indeces were supported for ranges (ds[-3:-1]) but not for single indexes (ds[-3]) or lists (ds[[-3,-2,-1]]</li>
            <li>3579786: LSpec routine handles fill more gracefully</li>
            <li>LSpec would shift result one bin</li>
            <li>3578171: code clean up broke forgotten feature where an http file could be plotted even if it wasn't part of http filesystem. Thanks Tami and Darren!</li>
            <li>3578229: orbit 00003 and 3 were not recognized as equivalent as other codes see it, so pngwalks would fail.</li>
            <li>3577939: orbit files must have at least one valid orbit because mediawiki doesn't provide file-not-found code</li>
            <li>make pngwalk would fail to show pngwalk when version was used.  Thanks Matt!</li>
            <li>3578898: improve feedback in spectograms when all timetags appear to be fill.</li>
            <li>rte_1710483042: check for RENDER_TYPE assumed that the result was non-null.</li>
            <li>rank 2 depend_1 can switch back and forth between stack of line plots and spectrogram</li>
            <li>reduce the number of processor threads (for now) in hopes to reduce load on Dan's server, which sometimes drops plots</li>
            <li>events data set in qdataset didn't render properly because under-implemented copy method dropped properties.</li>
            <li>fixes for bugs found in CDAWeb source discovered by Bob's plot everything script.</li>
            <li>old "|slice(2)" was mis-handled in metadata sprocess, causing RTE</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
