        <p><small>Bill noted that Autoplot would sometime use different locations for ticks in a stack plot.  This is fixed.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3605224: major ticks don't line up when one axis of stack has labels.</li>
            <li>3605415: CDF type "spectrogram>noauto", and user pref for spectrogram</li>
            <li>3605230: jython rank zero result of gt ought to be a boolean</li>

            <li>3604985: CDF DELTA_PLUS/DELTA_MINUS define bins for NN Spectrogram</li>
            <li>3604265: partial load of timeseries when scanning around.</li>
