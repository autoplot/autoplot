        <p><small>The Tear-Off Tabs code got some attention.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2013a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <ul>
            <li>1083: garbled tools list when adding tool</li>
            <li>1082: opacity in aggregation</li>
            <li>1079: tearoff tabbed pane does a better job with labels for the windows.</li>
            <li>1081: eventListColumn was broken from v2013a_8 through v2013a_9</li>
            <li>tearoff tabbed pane does a better job with labels for the windows.</li>
            <li>eventListColumn was broken from v2013a_8 through v2013a_9</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1073: switching renderers requires reset, broken after bugfix 1065.</li>
            <li>The highest bin wasn't copied over in fftPower.</li>

            <li>1065: flicker while adjusting slice index</li>
            <li>1061: ctrl-S in script editor allows save to cache and will cause people to loose work</li>
            <li>replace file action re-implemented so new dom avoids resets and is closer to old dom.</li>
            <li>don't use valid range as typical range when SCALEMIN,SCALEMAX are missing in CDF.</li>
            <li>clarify string indicating slice1 was done when DEPEND_1 was time-varying</li>
            <li>waitUntilIdle would fail to wait when the axis annotations were added, so test037 was failing.</li>

            <li>Mike at LANL pointed out that |multiply(-2) wouldn't work.</li>
            <li>Export panel additional options was not properly disabled when there were no options, resulting in RTE.</li>
            <li>TT2000 metadata would be misinterpreted as code would convert metadata to doubles</li>
            <li>1059: history.txt in headless mode, don't write to history during headless batch processing.</li>
            <li>completions in zip file systems would not work properly.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
