        <H3>Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>

        <img alt="screenshot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>Another round of improvements with the LSpec routine so that it can now deal with missing data.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tweak menu labels in the file menu</li>
            <li>3579786: LSpec routine handles fill more gracefully</li>
            <li>3574831: code clean up broke forgotten feature where an http file could be plotted even if it wasn't part of http filesystem. Thanks Tami and Darren!</li>
            <li>3578229: orbit 00003 and 3 were not recognized as equivalent as other codes see it, so pngwalks would fail.</li>
            <li>3577939: orbit files must have at least one valid orbit because mediawiki doesn't provide file-not-found code</li>
            <li>make pngwalk would fail to show pngwalk when version was used</li>
            <li>3578898: improve feedback in spectograms when all timetags appear to be fill.</li>
            <li>reduce the number of processor threads (for now) in hopes to reduce load on Dan's server, which sometimes drops plots</li>

            <li>3575260: keep track of last location, because Ubuntu 12.04 opens windows up in odd places (off screen with 2 displays)</li>
            <li>remove unnecessary synchronized block in DasAxis</li>
            <li>rte_1627148566: Pure-java CDF didn't close files propertly, causing RTEs on Windows.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
