        <p><small>Autoplot plots data from a random CDF file, in this case sounder data from Alouette2.</small></p>
        
	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li> bugfix in autohistogram, most of data treated as outliers.
</li><li> tweaks to guess cadence algorithm, add explicit test for detecting log spacing.  loosen up for log spacing.
</li><li> refactorings in Autoplot to decouple GUI from DOM model, this is to support applet and servlet use.
</li><li> refactor das2 to factor out dasml, legacy system for serializing das2 applications.
</li><li> make png walk allows output time format to specified instead of inferring format from aggregated URI.  
<ul><li> This allows use with datasets like TSDS that do not use aggregation.
</li><li> Also allows finer control like producing hourly plots.

</li></ul></ul>
<p>
        
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> Applet suffers from same seven second delay, applet can show display
</li><li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li><li> race condition with setSliceDimension and setFillDataSet results in "inconvertable units"
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>data is input from:

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
