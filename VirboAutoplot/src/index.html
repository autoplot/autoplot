	<p>This demonstration application attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and dods servers.  
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Additional metadata can then 
be applied to the data, for example, specifying valid range and fill data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.            
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
        <ul><li> bugfix: several major bugfixes leading to quirky behavior corrected in CopyPlot, etc.
</li><li> Overview panel support reintroduced with DOM Connector objects.
</li><li> Bindings made more transparent.  
</li><li> Refactor DomNode diffs to return Diff objects with do/undo functions.
</li><li> metadata binds to single panel.
</li><li> statistics node gets ascii art histogram. 
</li><li> copy panel must be used to have two plots bound by the xaxis.
</li><li> plots can be unbound.
</li><li> cadence calculation improved.
</li><li> bugfixes from production branch, valid_range and fill are reset when the dataSource is reset.
</li></ol>
<p>Known Bugs:
</p>
<ol><li> TimeSeriesBrowse still doesn't work.
</li>
</ul>

	<p>data is input from: 
	<li>ascii files (.dat,.txt)</li>
        <li>binary files (.bin)</li>
	<li>excel spread sheets (.xls)</li>
	<li>das2Streams (.d2s or .das2Stream)</li>
        <li>QStreams (.qds), QDataSet on a das2Stream
	<li>netcdf files (.nc,.ncml)</li>
        <li>cdf files(.cdf)</li>
	<li>dods servers (.dds)</li>
        <li>Cluster Exchange Format files (.cef)</li>
        <li>Fits Format Files</li>
        <li>ViRBO's TSDS server</li>
        <li>Plasma Wave Group das2 Server</li>
        <li>Images (.jpg, .png, .gif)</li>
	</p>
	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
	<li>Vector quantities such as B(GSM) are plotted as a stack of lineplots, with limited controls.</li>

         more information than this launch page.</p>
