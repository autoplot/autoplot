        <p><small>Two plot elements use the same data source, which contains a slice operation.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2016a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Experimental <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot.dmg">Mac Release</a> is available.
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2016-03-31 r18598):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1545: render type fails to switch because of extraneous event firings from data panel.</li>

            <li>Events bar should allow for units sloppiness when X values are Stevens' ratio scale units.</li>
            <li>don't assume that rank0 datasets will use digital renderer, they my use eventsBar.</li>

            <li>CDF where constraint works when data is rank 4 and filter data is rank 0.</li>
