        <p><small>Submit RTE dialog now has button to switch over to sending email, to support networks where http post isn't allowed.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>jython getItem for QDataSet could fail if dataset was not writable.</li>
            <li>trimDataSet's trim operation wouldn't allow a trim(0,len) operation to work.</li>
            <li>jython invoke(name,PyObject args) did not properly wrap the function
            <li>bookmarks download timeout was in milliseconds instead of seconds, which caused RTE now that there is a 12 hour limit.</li>

            <li>2987871: limit the number of records formatted to the log console BEFORE formatting them, not after</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
