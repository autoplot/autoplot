        <p><small>New features are included in vap files now, including outside labels, ticklen, and disable cadence check.</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is the first production release of this branch.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3461160: QStream Typical_MIN can't be Number, even though spec says Number is okay</li>
            <li>3461159: Add plot from bug sequence</li>
            <li>3456234: script editor context menu needs tooltips</li>
            <li>3458258: No feedback for bad bookmarks file.  Handle untitled folders</li>
            <li>3436922: Returning from rank 3 stack of plots to spectrogram would fail because the process string was not handled properly.</li>
            <li>averageGen, script command for reducing data, property handling cleaned up</li>
            <li>CDF lengths of high rank datasets in editor properly reported (+1 errors).</li>
            <li>New CDF code assumed that var_type existed</li>
            <li>bugfix: Format editor panels were not being loaded into release.</li>
            <li>bugfix: circular call detector depth=70 was too shallow, sometimes it's actually that deep.  New limit is 100.</li>
            <li>bugfix: code in QStream StreamDescriptor seemed to imply that native byte order was the default for the stream, it should be little_endian.  </li>
            <li>3458256: virtual variables would use the wrong filename</li>
            <li>3454451: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException sequence Bob noticed.  check bounds</li>
            <li>ASCII file reader left open an input stream, causing problems with long IDL batch processes.</li>
            <li>3454378: old code reseting link thickness and symbol size removed from in autorange.</li>
            <li>3398551: bug in bug reporting system meant that only the linenumber was used to create the hash.</li>
            <li>3002087: ds= dom.controller.getDataSourceFilter().controller.&lt;COMP&gt;.</li>
            <li>3380223: hourglass cursor icon after inspect icon.  reset to normal cursor in finally block.  Scott B at Iowa observed that if the resource is not found then the hourglass is left on.
            <li>bugfix: don't show last URI from history when starting. </li>
            <li>3448593: I now need to reset the size for use within scripts, and I had a typo in the setSize( getWidth(), getWidth() )</li>
            <li>3441461: plotx with multiple parameters</li>
            <li>3399323: Background and foreground colors do not update</li>
            <li>3449573: code to check for white on white, etc, more aggressively</li>
            <li>3441434: data post processing stays insensitive, basic mode</li>
            <li>3444673: Remote bookmark files can be cached so loading is only done when necessary</li>
            <li>3198392: remote bookmarks loaded immediately and on event thread.  Show local first, then load remote 10sec later</li>
            <li>3440253: consider filesystem caching in memory vs .listing files.  Http file systems now cache listings on disk.</li>
            <li>3373605: avoid null use in the DOM.</li>
            <li>3399323: Background and foreground colors do not update on style tab.</li>
            <li>2997820: Clean up automatic insertion of timerange so that 2010-01-01 is not used when it was never entered</li>
            <li>3448593: Craig's overlap/add plot bug.  Add/delete additional plot would destroy layout because em offsets were ignored when identifying overlaps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3430414: sc->getCompletions null when complete</li>
            <li>3440253: consider filesystem caching in memory vs .listing files</li>
            <li>aggregation didn't allow wildcards like (.*) to be used, now it does.</li>
            <li>3395693: FTP filesystem caching assumed a static remote site, now new listings are made up to once every 20 seconds (as with http)</li>
            <li>Ops.interpolate preserves metadata</li>
            <li>fill not identified in Ops.magnitude</li>
            <li>Operations pipeline correctly handles metadata by dropping external metadata for unsupported functions.  Before we would just ignore them, so data and metadata would not match up.</li>
            <li>3436569: Double-slicing (Rank 4 to Rank 2, |slice2(0)|slice1(0)) would not be properly reported in Operations field</li>
            <li>3436922: in slicing of SpaceWeather(20,8,3) where changing the slice wouldn't reset properly</li>
            <li>3436911: in automatic slicing of vap+inline:ripples(20,8,3).  Adjusting slice index wouldn't adjust child slices.
            <li>bugfix label of in-line dataset in rich ASCII files</li>
            <li>Spectrogram render type correctly restored from vap file.  Before the renderType node would get close, but NoInterpolate mode would not work.</li>
            <li>3437327: two column csv without time location units wouldn't plot as it would have with the AsciiDataSource, now it does.</li>
            <li>3438527: getViewWindow() returns null after second is closed</li>
            <li>3439598: CDF variable with three channels having same name</li>
            <li>bugfixes with remote bookmarks, when remote folder contains other remote folders</li>
            <li>in applot.pro, check for NaN's before byteswap</li>
            <li>in IDL/Matlab bridge, error reporting is improved.</li>
            <li>logic for guessing timerange supports non-aggregating data sources, and guesses before entering GUI.</li>
            <li>expert/basic mode code accidentally turned overplot button back on in add plots GUI.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>&lt;update check="background"&gt; should speed up launch a little more</li>
            <li>ask before quitting when "close" is pressed and this is the last panel</li>
            <li>popup menus for axis tab show macros like %{RANGE}</li>

<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	</p>
	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
        <ul>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
        </ul>
