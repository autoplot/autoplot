        <p><small>New test140 makes it easy to test to see that a set of URIs doesn't change.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"24 hours" / "60 minutes" works properly now (=24)</li>
            <li>poor feedback when malformed cdf is used</li>
            <li>plot id changes are propogated through the rest of the vap.</li>
            <li>filenames with spaces would cause problems again.</li>
            <li>SemanticOps.isTableDataSet wouldn't count rank 2 table with rank 2 ytags as table.</li>
            <li>3611281: Clean up TSB requests when a set of plots shares a time axis.  This bug would cause excessive hits to the das2servers.</li>
            <li>Test100 and other tests work properly again</li>
            <li>3611375: waitUntilIdle properly counts an active editor as idle.</li>
            <lI>3611210: test002 occasionally hangs</li>
            <li>rte_0665049794: changes to improve handling of output from fftPower. </li>
            <li>rfe 3596086: CDF Java implementation now implements slice1 to save memory</li>
            <li>more corrections for Windows names like c:\foo\file.txt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve support for bins datasets for tags.  slice0 didn't properly handle this, or the display data slice.</li>
            <li>old NN and spectrogram routines didn't handle bins tags, seriously misrepresenting the data.</li>
            <li>autoplot_data/config/system.properties includes rangeChecking switch after bins datasets caused incorrect rendering of data.</li>
            <li>Java CDF reader improves support for slice1 by slicing as each block is read in.</li>
            <li>waitUntilIdle checks the event queue again for pending updates (test018 would fail occasionally)</li>
            <li>test100 (Jemmy GUI testing) and test037 (user scripts) are functional again.</li>
            <li>rte_0932474502: User arm at Iowa would get runtime errors about width=0 on SunOS.  </li>
            <li>3610169: JythonDataSources wouldn't reject if the timeseries was not specified, causing ranges to reset because it wouldn't adopt the axis range.</li>
            <li>Steve at Goddard pointed out that is nearly impossible to select multiple plots and swap two plots' positions on a mac without a mouse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
	    <li>add createEvent method to make it easy to create events datasets in scripts.</li>
            <li>add setLayout and fixLayout commands to jython.</li>
            <li>add getElementById to application controller.</li>
            <li>add more efficient method for specifying das2server URIs that doesn't require parsing timeranges.</li>
            <li>scripts called from the command-line with --script= will reflect uncaught exceptions in exit status.</li>
            <li>test140 introduced, to support testing URI lists written by others.</li>
            <li>introduce autoplot_data/config/system.properties</li>
            <li>lanlNN can be made the default NN for testing now with a system property.</li>
            <li>data_$Y$m$d_$v.$v.$v.dat is now okay, which is more likely to be discovered by users than is $(v,sep)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>greaterOf and lesserOf methods introduced</li>
            <li>submit runtime error has button to switch to email submit, supporting environments where post is not allowed.</li>
            <li>QStream now has int8 transfer type to support CDF_TT2000 timetags.</li>
            <li>Additional ticks from... dialog keeps a separate history.</li>
            <li>Introduction of SparseDataSet, backed by a map and used to easily describe bundles.</li>
            <li>finally, ~ can be used in the address bar to refer to one's home folder</li>
            <li>export data disabled options are not valid.</li>
            <li>TITLE property is propogated through fftPower</li>
            <li>interpolate binXinterpY introduced.</li>
            <li>checkQube introduced to detect when datasets are really QUBEs and some opperations apply.</li>
            <li>Jython invokeLater command introduced to support simple concurrent scripts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
