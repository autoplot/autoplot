	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3479676: improve feedback with misformatted extension files. Applet had been failing to compile and I finally tracked this down.</li>
            <li>3480193: cacheTag added to result of Jython data source script when TimeSeriesBrowse is detected, so that the script is not called for zoom in.</li>
            <li>bugfix on Windows with the ftp filesystem when a file already exists, which prevented the CDAWeb module from working properly on some machines.</li>
            <li>3475644: in downloadResourceAsTempFile, where multiple threads would step on each other's work.  </li>
            <li>3479791: LogConsole/logger.log prevents datasets from garbage collected from memory</li>
            <li>3479791: Metadata panel used das2 CombinedTreeModel which held references to datasets as well.</li>
            <li>bugfix: deadlock could occur because of synchronization in UndoRedoSupport where it would create the thumbnail.</li>
            <li>JythonDataSource script= keyword supported properly in editor.</li>
            <li>3480889: "address bar" menu item moved to underused "view" menu, "provide feedback" moved to "help"</li>
            <li>size of the subpanel help links reduced to just the label, to reduce accidental clicks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3469219: handle units in append.  For example LANL has files where timetags are always from start of day</li>
            <li>bugfix: Turns out "ms since 1992-09-13T00:00" in a QStream would not be interpreted as a time.  Now SemanticOps.lookupUnits is used.</li>
            <li>bugfix: rank3 copyValues IDL/Matlab adapter failed because the length(i0) was used instead of length(i0,i1), leaving result mostly zeroes.</li>
            <li>bugfix: migrate changes from the CDF Java library to support the same virtual variables</li>
            <li>3469880: tooltips should go on field labels, not on the label itself. </li>
            <li>bugfix: getParam( 'timerange', '1997-Jan' ) wouldn't support TimeSeriesBrowse because "Jan" was not [a-z]*</li>
            <li>updates to auralizeTool so that it works again</li>
            <li>clean up aggregate GUI, so previews are shown and one code is used to form aggregations</li>
            <li>bugfix: extra messages "autolayout was set to false" because all prefs were read just to get NN</li>
            <li>profiling to find problem spots for long batch runs</li>
            <li>limit undo list to 100 states to support long batch runs</li>
            <li>3471016: move more GUI operations to event thread to avoid deadlocks</li>
            <li>ytagsDataSet gave Y[X] -> indgen() instead of Y.</li>
            <li>bugfix: digital renderer color was not bound to foreground color.</li>
            <li>bugfix: rank 2 [:,[X,Y,Z]] scheme supported in SeriesRenderer.</li>
            <li>update contour function to return bundle [:,[X,Y,Z]]</li>
            <li>bugfix: python supports ds[:,0] as unbundle, before it would drop metadata making it useless for bundles</li>
            <li>bugfix: in plotx, allow symbol='stars' by loosing up code that looks for values in enumeration</li>
            <li>bugfix: guard against ordinal units getting into axis setting.</li>
            <li>bugfix: rank 4 was never coded for TrimStrideWrapper.java, so python ds[:,:,:,4:6] would fail, clean up to today's qdataset</li>
            <li>bugfix: python supports ds[:,0] as shorthand for unbundle, before it would drop metadata making it useless for bundles</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3479591: tearoff tabs can be dropped into child container</li>
            <li>removeBackground1 and removeBackground0 provide in-line means of running background removal on data.</li>
            <li>cache result of FFTUtil.getFreqDomainTagsForPower, to save memory since this is repeated for each record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>guessNameFor(URI) introduced, and Jython script getDataSet completion attempts to suggest better name than "ds"</li>
            <li>add fftPowerDelta1024 to CDF virtual variable functions</li>
            <li>improve support for filesystem completions like .../1wire/dot4_data/$Y/$m/$d/10.&lt;COMP&gt;</li>
            <li>LSpec code updated to work with today's Autoplot, and included in single-jar release</li>
            <li>NetCDF/HDF5 reader supports constraints like ds[0:10] to allow read of huge files.</li>
            <li>box zoom detected and described efficiently in undo list</li>
            <li>add  Ops.flatten function, before we had only flattenRank2</li>
            <li>introduce SemanticOps.getLooseUnitsConverter, which allows a ratiometric unit to be compared to a dimensionless. (2 kg).gt(1) </li>
            <li>simplify code and allow ds[r] to be used where ds is rank 2 and r is rank 1</li>
        </ul>

</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>
