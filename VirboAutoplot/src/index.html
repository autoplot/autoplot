        <p><small>Data from a U.S.G.S. data server shows the height of the Iowa and Cedar Rivers in the 2008 floods.</small></p>
        
	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li> bugfix: dataset selector completion on a remote file brings up the data source editor, not a single completion of the filename.
</li><li> plots and panels flash as they are selected
</li><li> autolabel property for panels, plots, and axes completes fixes to autoranging vap files.
</li><li> bugfix 2792362: aggregation and context overview resets zoom.
</li></ul>
<p>
        
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> Applet suffers from same seven second delay, applet can show display
</li><li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li><li> race condition with setSliceDimension and setFillDataSet results in "inconvertable units"
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>data is input from: 
	<li>ASCII files (.dat,.txt)</li>
        <li>binary files (.bin)</li>
	<li>Excel spread sheets (.xls)</li>
	<li>das2Streams (.d2s or .das2Stream)</li>
        <li>QStreams (.qds), QDataSet on a das2Stream
	<li>netcdf files (.nc,.ncml)</li>
    <li>HDF5 files</li>
        <li>cdf files(.cdf)</li>
	<li>dods servers (.dds)</li>
        <li>Cluster Exchange Format files (.cef)</li>
        <li>Fits Format Files</li>
        <li>ViRBO's TSDS server</li>

        <li>Images (.jpg, .png, .gif)</li>
        <li>Wav audio files</li>
	</p>
	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>

         more information than this launch page.</p>
