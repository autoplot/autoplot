        <p><small>Color scatter mode was broken back in December, and tests did not catch the mistake.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2013b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <p>Bugfixes (2014-02-11):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chris noticed that the new code that sorts das2server folders and files would drop nodes.</li>
            <li>Chris noticed that the vap files don't save the displayTitle property</li>
            <li>1157: allow renders to specify if they have autoranged a dimension.<li>
            <li>file chooser in the resourceURI dialog didn't set the current directory properly.</li>
            <li>four-argument-histogram routine now takes datums and strings as arguments.</li>
            <li>jython (a,b)=myFunc() now supports a,b in selection.</li>
            <li>tab completion on the address bar works again with JythonDataSource.</li>
            <li>1156: Scott's script shows that color scatter was broken in December</li>
            <li>timeSeriesBrowse resulted in timerange being added to scripts in jyds editor when it wasn't needed</li>
            <li>das2server delays loading icons.  The way it was coded would block GUI until they were loaded</li>
            <li>Autoranging handles where lots of zeros are found in differences, which would cause problems</li>
            <li>1137: back off recent changes after seeing it mucked up Jemmy tests (and interactive use by clients) with demo 5 (stack of series).</li>
            <li>Red squiggle used to indicate errors in the Jython editor, the old block offered no feedback when highliting.</li>
            <li>scripts are loaded off the event thread</li>
            <li>Jython data source editor would not handle RESOURCE_URI correctly.</li>
	    <li>1148: reference cache finally gets immutability right, by making dataset immutable before it enters the cache.</li>
            <li>1145: just don't offer $Y$m01 as a completion.  This was put in to support CDAWEB, and direct CDAWEB support lessens the need for this</li>
            <li>remove RANGE_CHECK because it would cause RTE when it's legitimate to query zero-length qube datasets for other dimensions</li>
            <li>automatic completions editor works for URIs that don't have a file, like vap+orbit:</li>
            <li>Application-Name and Codebase to manifest to get rid of warning messages.</li>
            <li>documentation popup on script editor works again.</li>
            <li>SortDataSet called with zero-length sort list is trivially okay.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DataSetSelector focus on a mac made it easy to loose URI when using completions.</li>
            <li>1144:"CDF URI needs an argument" still lingers (in webstart single-instance hander)</li>
            <li>bounds of axis annotation labels corrected, before there was a 50px kludge which would leave unnecessary whitespace to the left of labels</li>
            <li>code that flattens waveforms for SeriesRenderer picks a unit that improves precision</li>
            <li>calculate CADENCE in Reduction.reducexWaveform to correct lines connecting waveform bursts</li>
            <li>RPW Group's data looked bad with LANL NN rebinning because cadence detection failed.  Pull out code that infers bins from ytags.</li>
            <li>catch more RTEs in Jython Script panel when using completions.</li>
            <li>1142: remove old code that would reset the timerange when switching das2servers.  This could break bindings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>another round of findbugs</li>            
            <li>formatDataSet back to ScriptContext in new attempts to clean up security.</li>
            <li>drag a box to select multiple plots on layout panel</li>
            <li>drag on layout panel is shortcut for swap</li>
            <li>axis flipped property is supported in the vaps.</li>
            <li>Allow smooth on rank 2 datasets, smoothing on the first dimension (usually time).</li>
            <li>internal rbsp orbits updated to 2014-02-03</li>
            <li>das2server lists folders separately from data sources.</li>
            <li>All CDF Global metadata now appears under "GlobalAttributes" node in metadata tab.</li>
       </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvements to the thin client</li>
            <li>Bookmarks logic allows users to review bookmarks before using them.</li>
            <li>Inline data source now has editor panel, with discovery.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
