        <p><small>More fun comparing time series datasets against one another.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2016a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p>Experimental <a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot.dmg">Mac Release</a> is available.

            <li>rfe509: maybeCreateDasPeer should check headless before adding an export data button to the horizontal and vertical slice.</li>
            <li>1646: correction to overplot of TSB of TSB without timeaxis flips back to timeaxis.  Thanks, Ivar!</li>
            <li>1649: autoranging failure where code to support TSBs without timeaxis inadvertently would allow plot below TSBs to reset axis.  Thanks, Bill!</li>
            <li>1647: changes to HTML source to support "3.4 sec" broke test 140.</li>
            <li>1648: new issue with URI handling, where the trailing / gets encoded, and don't look for 2014/.gz automatically.</li>

            <li>ImageDataSource alpha channel was upside-down, relative to the other channels.</li>
            <li>CSV and ASCII table reader use skipLines consistently (instead of skip), and this is presented in completions.</li>

            <li>1624: local .gz files are now uncompressed automatically.  Create-parent-directories portion needed to be synchronized.</li>
