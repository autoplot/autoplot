        <p><small>Fun bug as the Pitch Angle Distribution plots got some attention.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2014a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <p>Bugfixes (2014-07-22):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tweaks to the jython editor panel automatic GUI.</li>
            <li>minor improvements to CEF including UNITS, DELTA_PLUS/DELTA_MINUS, showing data before support data.</li>
            <li>rank 2 data was misread in the CEF reader.</li>
            <li>http://autoplot.org/autoplot.jnlp?bookmarks:...bookmarks.xml now works in re-enter code.</li>
            <li>medianFilter had a bug where repeated values were not counted twice.  Thanks Kenzie!</li>
            <li>spectrogram style panel comes up for PitchAngleDistribution mode now, which is slightly better than Series panel.</li>
            <li>don't load the file automatically into the jython editor if it is already loaded.  This is dangerous and distracting.</li>
            <li>pitchAngleDistribution mode wouldn't get a colorbar because it wasn't installed in the canvas</li>
            <li>medianFilter was never put in the filters list</li>
            <li>jyds would use 2010-01-01 (the default timerange) incorrectly.</li>
            <li>check for zero-length datasets in extent function, this was preventing reduceMean from working with all-fill records.</li>
            <li>use SpectrogramStylePanel for pitchAngleDistribution</li>
            <li>export to .wav file checks for non-monotonically increasing data, after discovering das2server would repeat records.</li>
            <li>reduceMean checks for NaNs, and treats them as fill data to be consistent with other codes.</li>
            <li>1224: TSB load when timerange is context (not x-axis), zoom in on timerange </li>
            <li>1222: next/â€‹prev buttons get into funky state as if not updating</li>
            <li>1226: rich headers containing a value element will not be connected to the data column by implicit name (P1).</li>
            <li>1216: series renderer misconfigured for large datasets rendering.</li>
            <li>1217: Spectrogram rebinner reverts after change and TSB reload.</li>
            <li>1215: occasional blips in SeriesRenderer http://www.sarahandjeremy.net:8080/hudson/job/autoplot-test140/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/diffs.test141_file__home_jbf_ct_autoplot_vap_bugs_pw_generalPathBlips_generalPathBlips.vap.png</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
