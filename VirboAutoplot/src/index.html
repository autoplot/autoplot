    <H3>Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>

        <img alt="screenshot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>The cadence-guessing code is loosened up so that low-energy energy channels are connected.  Also, an experimental change to the
                layout tab is shown..</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3522211: FTP file locking error with FtpFileSystem on Windows.  Feedback of the error is corrected reported to the user.</li>
            <li>minor cleanup of CDAWeb GUI, such as sorting recent datasources.  And failure to update when a source is selected twice.</li>
            <li>Datum to Rank0DataSet converter handles fill</li>
            <li>minimum sizes set properly in PNGWalk tool so that tearing off and shrinking won't result in errors</li>
            <li>timeparser.parse( 20010209 ) with $Y$m01 would not throw parse exception, so $Y$m01 was offered as agg suggestion when it is not valid</li>
            <li>small round of findbugs cleanup, download resource as temp file uses hex for hashcode</li>
            <li>rte_0764238028: the print to dialog parent was the canvas, causing confusion when canvas was torn off</li>
            <li>3520074: need wiki page describing timerange binding:  Behaviour is restored and test018 now tests this.</li>
            <li>3434934: http create method was still synchronized, so http://autoplot.org being down would prevent any other http sites from being created.</li>
            <li>bookmark descriptions would appear in parent nodes.</li>
            <li>Pngwalk didn't properly unload full-size images when precalculated thumbs weren't available, running out of memory</li>
            <li>jython library is loaded explicitly to support Java Webstart.</li>
            <li>add TrLDataSet to support column-major CDF files with TT2000 timetags.</li>
            <li>cadence-guessing code would be too restrictive for y tags in many cases.</li>
            <li>Jython scripts warn when params are overwritten, also code detecting time series browse needed to be loosened</li>
            <li>minor cleanup of CEF support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>excessive use of event thread blocked GUI responsiveness in first 5 seconds</li>
            <li>histogram didn't draw the last half bin</li>
            <li>thread clean up and slightly speed up startup performance</li>
            <li>ascii parser can parse times with the format "%Y %m %d %H%M".  This tweaked an under-implementation.</li>
            <li>TSDS supports timerange=P10D in URI, by using timerange if specified instead of StartTime</li>
            <li>general clean up of GUI actions performed off the event thread</li>
            <li>bugfix 3516161: procedure would leave orphan data source filters in the DOM and would fail.</li>
            <li>improve feedback from misformatted rich headers</li>
            <li>NetCDF works file files via FTP now.</li>
            <li>HDF5 via FTP works now, there was old code that still used NetCDF's access via HTTP which hid the bug.</li>
            <li>xtick tick labels look for close relevant tick when closest is fill, use **** to indicate fill.</li>
            <li>bookmarks have initial menu, indicating that bookmarks are being loaded</li>
            <li>I forgot to escape %Y's when converting to $Y's in PngwalkTool.</li>
            <li>export to IDLSAV fixed when a dataset doesn't have a name.</li>
            <li>move cache works again after a failed refactoring</li>
            <li>remote bookmarks offline status is properly indicated</li>
            <li>Ascii parser check for empty field at the end of a record, as in "1991-01-01 00:03,1490.0,I,"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>remote bookmarks loading is indicated via icons instead of [loading...]</li>
            <li>|valid() added to filters.</li>
            <li>|dbAboveBackgroundDim1 supports rows that are all fill.</li>
            <li>das2 server uses "server=peers" to add other das2servers to droplist</li>
            <li>minor performance enhancements, such as making length methods final</li>

            <li>Improved support for FITS tables</li>
            <li>switch --samp turns on connection to SAMP protocol and the Cluster Final Archive.</li>
            <li>more start time improvements by calculating secondary tabs off the event thread</li>
            <li>finally draw the canvas onto the layout GUI.</li>
            <li>descriptionUrl added to bookmarks files, to support remote bookmark lists.</li>

<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
