        <p><small>A scaling bug in butterworth filter is corrected.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2014a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <p>Bugfixes (2014-05-09):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>doResetRanges no longer throws RuntimeError when component process string fails, allowing ECT file with missing channel to load.</li>
            <li>MouseModule messages don't clobber Autoplot messages like "plotElement_1 selected"</li>
            <li>autoRanging was always turned off when loading in vaps, making it more difficult to produce vap files dynamically. v1.08 introduced.</li>
            <li>1184: reduce use of history.txt for repeat URIs motivated by filePollUpdating.</li>
            <li>1183: clean up old code that was mis-managing transition from stack of series plots to spectrogram fails (Akebono MCA)</li>
            <li>addTab adds the component in a scroll pane, to protect the rest of the GUI from scripts. (Sebastian's digitizer was huge.)</li>
            <li>putProperty checks isImmutable flag and copies dataset if it is not mutable.</li>
            <li>1182: CDF missing component labels resulted in editor failure</li>
            <li>Butterworth high-pass filter scale factor corrected.</li>
            <li>Survey places where locking is done without a try/finally block, which can hang the application.</li>
            <li>imax (index of the maximum value) was incorrectly coded to use MIN_VALUE (1e-308) instead of NEGATIVE_INFINITY</li>
	        <li>Rob R pointed out RTE when ftp:// is entered and inspect button pressed.</li>
            <li>440: any FileFilter needs to check for null from file.toString().  The DataPointRecorder didn't do this, Bill pointed out.</li>
            <li>don't print a warning when EnumerationUnits have the same ID.  This happens with "default" and is harmless.</li>
            <li>1180: use autoranging consistent with Series for Scatter</li>
            <li>Craig pointed out where makeAggregation was converting 20130402T00 to $Y$m$d-$H (T to -).</li>
            <li>rte 0948397190: runtime error in HDF5 reader when file is not found.</li>
            <li>1129: experiments with rendering after we would still see occasional failures.</li>
            <li>lanlNNRebinner supports time-varying Y tags.</li>
            <li>FUNCT or FUNCTION in C-implementation of CDF reader</li>
            <li>improve feedback with errors from VOTable reader.</li>
            <li>FileStorageModel had an bug where getFiles would return multiple references to the same file, since 2014/3/14</li>
            <li>FileStorageModel was missing getField to make clean way to get the version ($v)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rte 1178734273: occasional NullPointer on Windows fixed in file dialog.</li>
            <li>rte 1677040602: NullPointerException caused by thread issue.</li>
            <li>extraneous messages about can't serialize Level fixed.</li>
            <li>embed data didn't work properly with local files, because of double slashes that matter in zip files.</li>
            <li>improve handling of ephemeris ticks (TCA) when TCA data has gaps by limiting interpolation gaps.</li>
            <li>getPropertyType had Number as the type of SCALE_TYPE, not String.</li>
            <li>fix layout looks for rows with the same ID and unused rows.</li>
            <li>rte1171026815: runtime error during transitions due to unplottable bundle stored in series renderer.</li>
            <li>#03B1&semi; prints "xxx" so that its more clear that it should have been #x03B1&semi;
            <li>USER_PROPERTIES from Ascii reader caused crash when FFTPower was looking for Translation property.  Thanks Scott for pointing this out!</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
