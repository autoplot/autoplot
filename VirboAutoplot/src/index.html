	<p>This demonstration application attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Additional metadata can then 
be applied to the data, for example, specifying valid range and fill data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.            
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul><li> bugfixes:
<ul><li> various bugs with the CDF panel editor pointed out by bob
</li><li> non-double values for validmin, validmax would cause runtime exception
</li><li> spaces in zip file names
</li><li> 2791340: Excel spreadsheet editor works in webstart release
</li><li> runtime exception for "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: unable to find panel for das renderer" fixed

</li><li> panel height weights messed up after two panels.
</li><li> panel heights properly bind to das objects and are properly loaded and saved in vap files.
</li><li> cadence check disabling is done *after* we try to guess cadence.
</li><li> Excel and Ascii table GUIs [select] buttons clear the current selection so that any column can be selected.
</li><li> NullPointerException when export to Excel when dataset doesn't have units.
</li><li> many events didn't add to undo/redo list
</li></ul>
</li><li> cdf panel displays parameter descriptions.
</li><li> bug 2790177: splash screen added to help with long startup time (7sec) issue.
</li><li> ascii table parser supports quotes in csv's (1,2,"help",3)
</li><li> ascii table parser can parse array of times (before times had to be depend_0)
</li><li>Runtime Exception dialog allows exception reports to be submitted to Jeremy's server
</li></ul>
<p>Known issues:
</p>
<ul><li> 2769881 delete parent panel, then switch to spectrogram
</li><li> completion with aggregation doens't work
</li><li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> bug: aggregation sometimes still jumps when you adjust the z-axis. Demo 2.
</li><li> last recent URI is not added to DataSetSelector when Autoplot starts up.
</li><li> 2769881 delete parent panel, then switch to spectrogram
</li><li> 2712135 FileSystemCompletions must account for aggregation wildcards
</li><li> 2792362 aggregation and context overview resets zoom
</li><li> 2792363 add overplot resets zoom
</li></ul>


<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>data is input from: 
	<li>ASCII files (.dat,.txt)</li>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
