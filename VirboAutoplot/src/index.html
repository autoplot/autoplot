        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3597950: save as dialog kept forgetting last directory because of "file:/" prefix</li>
            <li>3578215: fix layout doesn't preserve relative heights, correcting "make same height" action</li>
            <li>double entries file:/*/*.vap and /*/*.vap are now subsumed in URI history</li>
            <li>Make aggregation finally handles versioning, looking for "vXX" or "vX.X.X"</li>
            <li>3596556: Jython scripts handling of FileNotFoundException</li>
            <li>3596098: canvas image on layout tab is always repainted, never cached</li>
            <li>work around javaws bug where png files can't be used for icons on Macs.</li>
            <li>clean up of bookmarks, when bookmark is dragged to or from remote folder.</li>
            <li>minor clean-up of scripts that used old CDAWeb names.</li>
            <li>documentation lookup in script editor is done off the event thread</li>
            <li>undo/redo bug where "unidentified change" would break things</li>
            <li>history dialog doesn't use data loading thread, minor bugfixes.</li>
            <li>TCA (empheris) progress wheel showed where the data loading thread needed to be synchronized because of double loads.</li>
            <li>3594789: poor feedback when component unbundles are incorrect.  setException must be called after setDataSet(null)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>series->spec->series showed where legend label wasn't set because of incorrect check for auto, which was not set properly</li>
            <li>reset method is no longer synchronized, since Java6 would sometimes get hung up in there</li>
            <li>specifying TYPICAL_MIN but not TYPICAL_MAX would cause NullPointerException in autoranging.</li>
            <li>CEF explicitly set SCALE_TYPE=linear if log was not specified.  Sometimes the data should be used to decide.</li>
            <li>autorange code has code to prevent use of log when SCALE_TYPE=linear.</li>
            <li>labels would not reset when switching from spec->series->spec->series.</li>
            <li>3590689: bugfixes with aggregation of qstreams when reducing CDF data with BUNDLE_1</li>
            <li>digitizer output .dat file is formatted so that Autoplot gets the column labels and units</li>
            <li>add kludge for Seth's data with rank2 DEPEND_1 to restore old labeling before AGU.</li>
            <li>add kludge for waveform display type where nT units are incorrectly labeled as seconds</li>
            <li>joinProperties handled DELTA_PLUS, DELTA_MINUS and WEIGHTS_PLANE</li>
            <li>long parameters in JythonDataSource dialog just have "default" for the button label</li>
            <li>put a space in jnlp title so it inserts linebreaks nicely on desktops</li>
            <li>CDF Rank2 BUNDLE properties read in when DEPEND_1 is Rank 2.</li>
            <li>add logging to aggregation to figure out why Dan's seeing inconsistent behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>command line on console tab keeps last 20 commands between sessions</li>
            <li>introduce secret feature for testing reference cache -DenableReferenceCache=true will enable the cache for CDF and aggregations.</li>
            <li>add collapse functions to scripting.  These were available in the processes but not by the same name in scripting.</li>
            <li>RBSP orbits updated to 2012-01-08</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>orbitMode=T and fontSize=2em added to events bar renderer controls which allows clear display of orbit number.</li>
            <li>undo list uses unicode arrow instead of ->, bindings to timerange are subsumed.</li>
            <li>pngwalks support in-line wildcards like http://apps-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/hudson/job/autoplot-test500/10*/artifact/diffs.test500_009.png</li>
            <li>makePngWalk command line arguments are echoed to stderr.</li>
            <li>in experimental plotx, yrange=[0,1000] implies that ylog=False</li>
            <li>.jy extension is automatically handled as a script.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=199733&atid=970682">see Source Forge</a>
        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
