        <H3>Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>

        <img alt="screenshot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>Quite a few of the datasources don't have editors, but all have completions.  Autoplot now creates
                GUIs automatically from the completions for those datasources without editors.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pngwalk now has show missing off by default.</li>
            <li>restore --bookmarks= command line switch, which was probably broken with remote bookmarks loading.</li>
            <li>guessSlice didn't consider existing slice, causing problems with high-rank datasets.</li>
            <li>das2 ephemeris labels wouldn't show up when legend labels would show component labels.</li>
            <li>FTP filesystem now uses real timestamps for remote files.  Thanks ftp4j!</li>
            <li>clean up leftover sloppiness and incorrect warnings in CDF reporting</li>
            <li>rte 0449679029: look for ") " in filters GUI instead of just " " because of reducex needs it.</li>
            <li>rte 1243117384: new check for timerange in JythonDataSource would result in null pointer exception when default time is used with logging</li>
            <li>"<url> <COMP>" would trigger index out of bounds because of trim.</li>

            <li>users can switch back and forth between series and spectrogram with complex slices</li>
            <li>limits on slices applied in the GUI to avoid index out of bounds errors</li>
            <li>support ISO8601 times spans like "2012-04-05T00:00/PT0.1S".  Before the seconds had to be an integers.</li>

            <li>tsb code can switch from looking at the xaxis to looking at the context more gracefully</li>
            <li>plot.context to dom.timeRange is automatic now.</li>
            <li>bugfix when unbundling is done automatically.  Before the y axis label was incorrect.</li>
            <li>print action was attached to focus, even though we added a print button to the slice dialog years ago<</li>
            <li>transpose would not handle BUNDLE_i correctly.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.

    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
