        <p><small>Adjusting the slice index no longer has the flickering.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2013a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
