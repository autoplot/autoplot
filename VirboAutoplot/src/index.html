        <p><small>All the elements of arrays in the global attributes of a CDF files are now shown.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2014a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <p>Bugfixes (2014-08-15):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Y-label is center-justified when there are multiple lines.</li>
            <li>spaces and underscores in component names are ignored, when exact matches cannot be found.</li>
            <li>getDataSet action in Jython limits suggested variable name to 30 characters</li>            
            <li>improve completions in PDS/PPI plugin, to support testing.</li>
            <li>PDS/PPI discovers can use times in second column.</li>
            <li>PDS/PPI can use .csv files.</li>
            <li>PDS/PPI uses "times=false" to speed things up for now.</li>
            <li>JNLP single-instance bug that resulted in NullPointerException</li>
            <li>CDF Metadata uses arrays when there are multiple values.  Thanks Ken for pointing this out.</li>
            <li>PDS/PPI file browsing is done off the event thread</li>
            <li>421: double load of Das2Source caused by mouse-wheeling</li>
            <li>Kristoff pointed out where Jython GUI wouldn't reset properly when dom.plots[0].yaxis.range was used as default.</li>
            <li>interpolation codes preserve more metadata</li>
            <li>jython completions allow selection for all argument combinations, not just one.</li>
            <li>completions-based editor bugfix, where it would not recognize HDF5 as file-based</li>
            <li>append wasn't able to append two datasets that had enumerations that didn't have the same units.  Now it can.</li>
            <li>kludge in URI formatting to use + instead of %20 in timeranges to improve ledgibility</li>
            <li>1065: reduce flickering caused by unneeded setDataSet(null)</li>
            <li>tweaks to the jython editor panel automatic GUI.</li>
            <li>minor improvements to CEF including UNITS, DELTA_PLUS/DELTA_MINUS, showing data before support data.</li>
            <li>rank 2 data was misread in the CEF reader.</li>
            <li>http://autoplot.org/autoplot.jnlp?bookmarks:...bookmarks.xml now works in re-enter code.</li>
            <li>medianFilter had a bug where repeated values were not counted twice.  Thanks Kenzie!</li>
            <li>spectrogram style panel comes up for PitchAngleDistribution mode now, which is slightly better than Series panel.</li>
            <li>don't load the file automatically into the jython editor if it is already loaded.  This is dangerous and distracting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pitchAngleDistribution mode wouldn't get a colorbar because it wasn't installed in the canvas</li>
            <li>medianFilter was never put in the filters list</li>
            <li>jyds would use 2010-01-01 (the default timerange) incorrectly.</li>
            <li>check for zero-length datasets in extent function, this was preventing reduceMean from working with all-fill records.</li>
            <li>use SpectrogramStylePanel for pitchAngleDistribution</li>
            <li>export to .wav file checks for non-monotonically increasing data, after discovering das2server would repeat records.</li>
            <li>reduceMean checks for NaNs, and treats them as fill data to be consistent with other codes.</li>
            <li>1224: TSB load when timerange is context (not x-axis), zoom in on timerange </li>
            <li>1222: next/â€‹prev buttons get into funky state as if not updating</li>
            <li>1226: rich headers containing a value element will not be connected to the data column by implicit name (P1).</li>
            <li>1216: series renderer misconfigured for large datasets rendering.</li>
            <li>1217: Spectrogram rebinner reverts after change and TSB reload.</li>
            <li>1215: occasional blips in SeriesRenderer http://www.sarahandjeremy.net:8080/hudson/job/autoplot-test140/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/diffs.test141_file__home_jbf_ct_autoplot_vap_bugs_pw_generalPathBlips_generalPathBlips.vap.png</li>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
