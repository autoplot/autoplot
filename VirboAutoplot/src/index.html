	<p>This demonstration application attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Additional metadata can then 
be applied to the data, for example, specifying valid range and fill data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.            
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
bugfixes:
<ul><li> problems with vap files resolved.
</li><li> download from authenticated FTP site works (such as ftp://user:pass@mrfrench.lanl.gov/).
</li><li> inconsistencies between Servlet and Applet initial view
</li><li> CDF depend_1 number of elements is incorrect.
</li></ul>
<li> introductory rank 4 support in QDataSet
</li><li> introduce KeyChain object for storing credentials of HTTP and FTP sites, and a basic authentication dialog when user:pass is used in the URIs.
</li><li> improvements to jython completion in script console, ctrl +/- resize in script console.
</li><li> minor improvements to png walk script at https://vxoware.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vxoware/autoplot/trunk/VirboAutoplot/src/scripts/pngwalk/makePngWalk.jy
</li><li> NOTE: vap load/save tightened up, which may cause some old vap files to break.
</li></ul>
        
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> Applet suffers from same seven second delay, applet can show display
</li><li> bug: aggregation sometimes still jumps when you adjust the z-axis.  Demo 2.
</li><li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li><li> race condition with setSliceDimension and setFillDataSet results in "inconvertable units"
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
