        <p><small>Minor tweaks to the undo list include checking for bindings to timerange.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
            displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3594789: poor feedback when component unbundles are incorrect</li>
            <li>reset method is no longer synchronized, since Java6 would sometimes get hung up in there</li>
            <li>specifying TYPICAL_MIN but not TYPICAL_MAX would cause NullPointerException in autoranging.</li>
            <li>CEF explicitly set SCALE_TYPE=linear if log was not specified.  Sometimes the data should be used to decide.</li>
            <li>autorange code has code to prevent use of log when SCALE_TYPE=linear.</li>
            <li>labels would not reset when switching from spec->series->spec->series.</li>
            <li>3590689: bugfixes with aggregation of qstreams when reducing CDF data with BUNDLE_1</li>
            <li>digitizer output .dat file is formatted so that Autoplot gets the column labels and units</li>
            <li>add kludge for Seth's data with rank2 DEPEND_1 to restore old labeling before AGU.</li>
            <li>add kludge for waveform display type where nT units are incorrectly labeled as seconds</li>
            <li>joinProperties handled DELTA_PLUS, DELTA_MINUS and WEIGHTS_PLANE</li>
            <li>long parameters in JythonDataSource dialog just have "default" for the button label</li>
            <li>put a space in jnlp title so it inserts linebreaks nicely on desktops</li>
            <li>CDF Rank2 BUNDLE properties read in when DEPEND_1 is Rank 2.</li>
            <li>add logging to aggregation to figure out why Dan's seeing inconsistent behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>local paths with /tmp in the path would fail.</li>
            <li>hugeScatter repaints properly, finally...</li>
            <li>cdf-java attempts to read to memory outside JVM, then falls back to JVM memory</li>
            <li>3586029: progress monitor cancel enabled for setTaskSize 1 of 3 (CDAWeb)</li>
            <li>rte_0818219940: null pointing when editing bookmarks</li>
            <li>3586030: one record of waveform data didn't autorange properly</li>
            <li>polar_fnl_ceppad-HISTe-lsort-l3_19970101_v1.0.0.cdf shows null pointer because failed to check for dimSizes=null</li>
            <li>3586034: multiple monitors on some Windows 7 locks up.  (Possible fix)</li>
            <li>validate data as it is read into aggregations to improve feedback</li>
            <li>George's problem where aggregation didn't work because of bug with reading 1-record CDFs</li>
            <li>shrink-vap-to-fit now scales fonts (and ems for layout) as well.</li>
            <li>3585373: CDF Java fails immediately with out of memory.  First attempt outside-JVM memory, then fall back to within JVM</li>
            <li>first progress indicator for loading in Ephemeris</li>
            <li>hugeScatter handles incorrect units like the scatter mode, putting up warning but plotting data anyway.</li>
            <li>TCAs (Emphemeris) in vap files are handled properly, so the date label is turned of when load a vap with emphemeris</li>

            <li>jython editor scroll increment set properly when editor has lots of arguments.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
