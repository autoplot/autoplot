        <p><small>I encountered a surprise feature of the script editor, that CTRL-K shows completions based on symbols in the script.</small></p>
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2013b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        SourceForge has changed the numbering of all the bugs.  If you go to the page
        https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/, "Search Bugs" in the upper left corner can be used
        to resolve old numbers.
        <p>Bugfixes (2014-03-05):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bob pointed out case where error bars would be left on the Series renderer display.</li>
            <li>more findbugs cleanup (down to 80)</li>
            <li>continue to remove synchronized code that could cause hangs</li>
            <li>add busy feedback to dataSetSelector web activity, since this can get hung up and the user has no indication of what's going on.</li>
            <li>periodic keyword for time parsing properly triggers TSB</li>
            <li>contour always had extra point (0,0) in result.</li>
            <li>clean up example in vap+inline GUI which was incorrect</li>
            <li>minor cleanup of wget-based file system.</li>
            <li>completions based on local cache folded case improperly.</li>
            <li>support EMFISIS hourly files when suggesting aggregations</li>
            <li>rte_0263418513: NetCDF spaces were not handled properly.</li>
            <li>clean up monitors, after seeing axis ephemeris / das2server would sometimes leave monitor hanging</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>allow timeout on eventsRenderer to be adjusted (property under controller node)</li>
            <li>reset scanRange when axis units are reset.</li>
            <li>all GUI initialization is done on the event thread, fixing occasional hangs on Linux.</li>
            <li>unnecessary fold case in local cache completions prevented "Flight" from showing</li>
            <li>suggestion aggregation code supports 20140216T03</li>
            <li>sanity checks on generate timeranges limit the number to 1000000 instead of hanging createPngWalk</li>
            <li>loosen up excessive synchronized block use in DataSourceController that could get hung up needlessly.</li>
            <li>spaces in NetCDF file names caused problems after check for matlab was installed.  Thanks sspagnol!</li>
            <li>createEvent doesn't make so many assumptions about the dataset it's appending to.</li>
            <li>upper case constants in inline data source were always used as property values.  Now only valid property names are treated this way.</li>
            <li>"scan" buttons renamed "step" buttons in anticipation of events lists</li>
            <li>George pointed out that slicer popups are offscreen on Windows when window is maximized.</li>
            <li>Recent startup code changes would occasionally cause hang on Linux when script panel was showing.</li>
            <li>mon.finished was never called in Das2DataSource, leaving spinner when emphemeris data is loaded.</li>
            <li>DE CDF data had rank 0 DELTA_PLUS.  This is supported now.</li>
            <li>Non-time strings got into the time range dialog, causing parse errors.</li>
            <li>update version in about dialog</li>
            <li>new code that sorts das2server folders and files would drop nodes. (Thanks Chris!)</li>
            <li>the vap files don't save the displayTitle property (Thanks Chris!)</li>
            <li>1157: allow renders to specify if they have autoranged a dimension.</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
    </ul>
