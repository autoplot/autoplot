    <H3>Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>

        <img alt="screen shot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>A bug associated with "internal" datasets is fixed, where plotting X,Y,and Z would result in the Z not being trimmed along with X and Y.  The color scatter
            plot below is updated as the application timerange is adjusted.</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A change in v2011a_7 caused datasets to fail to automatically bind to the application timerange.</li>
            <li>old code from original Autoplot was ignored render type guess code and set this based on monotonic property.</li>
            <li>guessCadenceNew would not tally deltas properly, resulting in incorrect cadence=0 for vap+inline:0,0,100,100,0,0;0,0,0,100,100,0</li>
            <li>link(x,y) shouldn't return a bundle dataset, it should return y(x).</li>
            <li>fftFilter threw out units.</li>
            <li>3482782: stress testing revealed some interesting memory leaks.  These are addressed.</li>
            <li>bugfixes in SeriesRenderer error bars and outline fillStyle when printing pointed out by Jon V.</li>
            <li>bookmarks update while user is in the menu would cause them to not update properly.  Now this is done on event thread.</li>
            <li>bugfix in cdf/java checking on variable lengths.  rank 2 data would indicate a length mismatch because of old code.</li>
            <li>ArrayDataSet trim didn't trim PLANE_0 property.  Now we use DataSetUtil.trimProperties for consistent behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3479676: improve feedback with misformatted extension files. Applet had been failing to compile and I finally tracked this down.</li>
            <li>3480193: cacheTag added to result of Jython data source script when TimeSeriesBrowse is detected, so that the script is not called for zoom in.</li>
            <li>bugfix on Windows with the ftp filesystem when a file already exists, which prevented the CDAWeb module from working properly on some machines.</li>
            <li>3475644: in downloadResourceAsTempFile, where multiple threads would step on each other's work.  </li>
            <li>3479791: LogConsole/logger.log prevents datasets from garbage collected from memory</li>
            <li>3479791: Metadata panel used das2 CombinedTreeModel which held references to datasets as well.</li>
            <li>bugfix: deadlock could occur because of synchronization in UndoRedoSupport where it would create the thumbnail.</li>
            <li>JythonDataSource script= keyword supported properly in editor.</li>
            <li>3480889: "address bar" menu item moved to underused "view" menu, "provide feedback" moved to "help"</li>
            <li>size of the subpanel help links reduced to just the label, to reduce accidental clicks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>data sources with TimeSeriesBrowse, that have a URI without the timerange, are accepted by binding automatically to the application timerange.</li>
            <li>getParam in jython scripts can be enumeration: getParam('sc','1','spacecraft',['1','2','3','4'])</li>
            <li>add FFTFilterType.TenPercentEdgeCosine for use with waves.</li>
            <li>resourceUri handled specially in JythonDataSource editor.</li>
            <li>support %{USER_PROPERTIES.x.y} and %{METADATA.x.y} in legend label.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3479591: tearoff tabs can be dropped into child container</li>
            <li>removeBackground1 and removeBackground0 provide in-line means of running background removal on data.</li>
            <li>cache result of FFTUtil.getFreqDomainTagsForPower, to save memory since this is repeated for each record.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=199733&atid=970682">see Source Forge</a>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>
