        <p><small>Data in Excel spreadsheets can now be accessed by row.</small></p>

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2012b branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 6 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Columns AA and up are plottable in Excel spreadsheet reader.</li>
            <li>CSV editor uses parts of the ascii table GUI to make a more usable editor, before it would just show first 20 lines.</li>
            <li>Dan upgraded the JPG metadata-extractor library to support Java 7.</li>
            <li>Time Range Tool would not accept time ranger string unless enter was pressed before exiting the GUI<li>

            <li>double entries file:/*/*.vap and /*/*.vap are now subsumed in URI history</li>
            <li>Make aggregation finally handles versioning, looking for "vXX" or "vX.X.X"</li>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
