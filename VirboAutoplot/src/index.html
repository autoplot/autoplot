    <H3>ViRBO Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>
	<img src="screen.png">
	<p>This demonstration application attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and dods servers.  
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Additional metadata can then 
be applied to the data, for example, specifying valid range and fill data.
	</p>
        
        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.            
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
        <li> add plot and axis context menus to bind to other plots, add connectors, add plots, etc.
</li><li> bugfixes for servlet
</li><li> bugfixes in data source editors for ascii tables and excel spreadsheets.</li>

<p>Known Bugs:
</p>
<li> SeriesRenderers accept context click anyway within concave region, causing confusion.  <a href="https://bugs-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/mantis/view.php?id=346" class="external text" title="https://bugs-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/mantis/view.php?id=346" rel="nofollow">bug report</a>
</li><li> If three panels plot three components, then the URI is reset to a rank 1 dataset, the extra panels are not removed.  A mechanism for detecting and automatically removing component panels is needed.
</li><li> Controls for removing and moving panels, plots, and dataSources is lacking.  DataSources are never removed from the application, but are often recycled.  Same is true with Plots and Panels.

</li><li> Rendering performance is poor on Fedora 10.  This has not been isolated to the OS, Java, or a new bug in the application.  Windows performance is fine.

	<li>ascii files (.dat,.txt)</li>
        <li>binary files (.bin)</li>
	<li>excel spread sheets (.xls)</li>
	<li>das2Streams (.d2s or .das2Stream)</li>

	</p>
	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
	<li>Vector quantities such as B(GSM) are plotted as a stack of lineplots, with limited controls.</li>

         more information than this launch page.</p>
