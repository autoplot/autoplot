    <H3>Autoplot Application (#{tag})</H3>
        <p><a href="autoplot.jnlp"><img src="launch.png"></a></p>

        <img alt="screenshot"  src="screen.png">
        <p><small>Simply adding a plot button to the bookmarks GUI allows the user to look at titles and descriptions easily when looking for a product.</small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2011 branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.  Note CDFs are only supported
            via the Java-based reader and Autoplot will attempt to use it when the C-based version is not available.  </p>

        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>finish up very initial filters dialog</li>
            <li>xtick tick labels look for close relevant tick when closest is fill, use **** to indicate fill.</li>
            <li>I forgot to escape %Y's when converting to $Y's in PngwalkTool.</li>
            <li>export to IDLSAV fixed when a dataset doesn't have a name.</li>
            <li>move cache works again after a failed refactoring</li>
            <li>remote bookmarks offline status is properly indicated</li>
            <li>NAME used for label of DEPEND_0, even when RichAscii headers had already assigned a label</li>
            <li>fftPower function knows what to do with TT2000-based timetags</li>
            <li>dbAboveBackground and other filters do not drop axis labels</li>
            <li>data tab has scrollpane when initially enabled so that canvas doesn't resize because of long dataset labels.</li>
            <li>3513630: empty field at the end of an ascii record doesn't prevent file from being parsed</li>
            <li>replace file messages up log z axis.  This is now corrected to check for autoranging.</li>
            <li>3510248: single instance code could result in hung application</li>
            <li>vertical slice works with data with non-monotonic tags</li>
            <li>remote bookmarks file with remoteURL buried deep in the tree is handled properly.</li>
            <li>don't show the main GUI when "pngwalk:" is used.</li>
            <li>bookmarks with remote URLs load properly when "bookmarks:..." is used to bring in new bookmarks</li>
            <li>bugfixes to allow rank 2 CDF data (stereo/swaves) to be read over openDAP.</li>
            <li>hung event thread detector writes to autoplot_data/log when event thread appears to be hung.</li>
            <li>das2server is more flexible about handing times.</li>
            <li>downloadResourceAsTempFile long filename bug fixed by using hash for long filenames</li>
            <li>ISO8601 char arrays in NetCDF/HDF5 can now be up to 35 characters long.  Any variable with DEPEND_0 is considered to have ISTP conventions.</li>
            <li>New filesystem stuff wouldn't clean up locks when create failed. (Thanks Hudson!)</li>
            <li>Major fix to filesystem stuff, where a hung filesystem create doesn't prevent further use of any filesystems (and Autoplot)</li>
            <li>fixes to rich ascii, including unbundle preserves bundle with proper labels, and support for enums</li>
            <li>check for cache area when saving Jython files was broken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ZipFileSystem had a bug that prevented its use in some situations.</li>
            <li>Initial HEAD request in HTTPFileSystem changed to GET request to support LANL.</li>
            <li>bugfix in AutoHistogram when log check would produce a different length histogram</li>
            <li>pngwalk views all accept mouse wheel events properly</li>
            <li>"pngwalk:" initial URI works now</li>
            <li>in CDAWEB, CRRES_H0_MEA and UY_1MIN_VHM have 10-day spans now.</li>
            <li>bugfix: negative cadence handled in http://www.rssd.esa.int/saweb/swics/data/1999/19990107.cdf?MATRIX_RATE_1</li>
            <li>c:/documents and settings/ is a hidden link on Windows 7, which when used resulted in null pointer exception</li>
            <li>various cleanup in das2server plugin</li>
            <li>omni2_h0_mrg1hr_$Y$(m,span=6)$d_v01.cdf with $d instead of 01 works fine.</li>
        </ul>
