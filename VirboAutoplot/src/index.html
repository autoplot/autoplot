        <p><small>Autoplot is used to plot data from IDL using the "applot" command.  Data in IDL is serialized
                to a das2Stream (soon a QStream) and the server interface is used to command Autoplot to
                plot the data.  This is useful for debugging in IDL when using IDL's plotting would interfere
                with the process being debugged.
            </small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>bugfix in copy panels when the plot contains parent and child panels.</li>
    <li>bugfix in QStreams, calculate resolution needed for time formatting.</li>
    <li>bugfix OpenDAP subsetting works with ISTP CDFs.</li>
    <li>bugfixes in hide/show colorbar, when overplots are used.</li>
    <li>bugfix in stack order of panels, so that spectrograms are inserted under lineplots.</li>
    <li>add das2 ripples dataset for demos and testing.</li>
    <li>bugfixes in sync, style node changes didn't make it out to the view layer, which affects load and save.</li>
    <li>bugfix: guess cadence is invoked when autorange is false, so that symbol connector is correct.</li>
    <li>bugfix: das2 renderers use weights property so that original dataset fill values are not clobbered.</li>
    <li>bugfix: introduce dsfReset property to panel controller to address perennial problems with syncing.</li>
    <li>for das2server data source, introduce GUI for selecting data sets.</li>
    <li>bugfix: spaces in filenames when exporting data is supported.</li>
    <li>introduce Aggregate All to tools menu.</li>
    <li>create pngwalk has option to create thumbnails as well</li>
    <li>bugfix when no preferences exist for recent or bookmarks.</li>
    <li>improvements to DomainDivider-based tick labelling, though it's not quite ready yet due to formatting</li>
    <li>handle unit "days since 1-1-1T00:00:00"</li>
    <li>bugfix in das2: toTimeStruct(Datum) rounded to nearest microsecond.</li>
    <li>bugfix in das2: format to nanosecond resolution failed.</li>
    <li>more tweaking of guess cadence code when there are <10 elements that are log spaced.</li>
    <li>introduce experimental peakIds() and peaks() in AutoHistogram, to support statistical gcd.</li>
</ul>
<p>


<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>data is input from: 
	<li>ASCII files (.dat,.txt)</li>
        <li>binary files (.bin)</li>
	<li>Excel spread sheets (.xls)</li>
	<li>das2Streams (.d2s or .das2Stream)</li>
        <li>QStreams (.qds), QDataSet on a das2Stream
	<li>netcdf files (.nc,.ncml)</li>
    <li>HDF5 files</li>
        <li>cdf files(.cdf)</li>
	<li>dods servers (.dds)</li>
        <li>Cluster Exchange Format files (.cef)</li>
        <li>Fits Format Files</li>

	</p>
	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
