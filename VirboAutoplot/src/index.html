        <p><small>Autoplot GUI is simplified for new users by hiding the data and
                layout tabs.  These tabs aren't needed for plotting a single-panel
                of lineplots or spectrograms.
            </small></p>

	<p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including local files and OpenDAP servers.
	Datasets are identified with URLs, and by the URL's extension a module is used to load the data into the internal data model.  Data is then
displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.
	</p>

        <p>This development release is an untagged version with experimental features.
        </p>
        
        <p>Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Panel slicing fixes many problems with the rank 3 slicing, and allows for alternate views of the data. (bug 2837674) </li>
    <li>template specs like %{RANGE}, %{CONTEXT}, %{UNITS} can be used in labels.</li>
    <li>Data Source refactorings finalize Data Source API.</li>
    <li>Apache VFS introduced, adding initial support for sftp (public keys only)</li>
    <li>Initial help documents added, including "getting started"</li>
    <li>new Data tab simplifies Axis tab.</li>
    <li>"Data" and "Layout" tabs are hidden by default, simplifying interface for new users.</li>
    <li>Improvements to CEF reading and bugfixes.</li>
<li>minor bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>

        <p><small>A Polar/Hydra spectrogram is sliced at two points in time.  Data can now be loaded once, and
                panels can display different slices of the data.  A new "Data" panel simplifies the axis panel
                and specifies data operations (such as slice or histogram) before display.
            </small></p>

<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> HugeScatter renderer needs to have the envelope (column min to max) painted to avoid Moire patterns.
</li><li> last URI is not added to DataSetSelector.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version. A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of www.autoplot.org will run this version. <b>Feedback on the function and quality of this release is greatly appreciated!</b></p>

	<p>data is input from: 
	<li>ASCII files (.dat,.txt)</li>
        <li>binary files (.bin)</li>
	<li>Excel spread sheets (.xls)</li>
	<li>das2Streams (.d2s or .das2Stream)</li>
        <li>QStreams (.qds), QDataSet on a das2Stream
	<li>netcdf files (.nc,.ncml)</li>
    <li>HDF5 files</li>
        <li>cdf files(.cdf)</li>
	<li>dods servers (.dds)</li>
        <li>Cluster Exchange Format files (.cef)</li>
        <li>Fits Format Files</li>

	</p>
	<p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
	<li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
	<li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality cannot be plotted.</li>
