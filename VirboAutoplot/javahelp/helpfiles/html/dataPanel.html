<p>The Data Panel contains controls for processing the dataset after it is loaded.
    For example, we can explicitly specify the fill value when the dataset has failed to identify it.
</p>

<p>The data source sub panel controls the focus data source node.  The URI of the data is indicated for convenience in a small font.
    Valid Range explicitly overrides the valid range of the dataset.  This is also useful for limiting the data we want to look at.
Fill Value allows the fill value to be reset as well.</p>

<p>Panel Post Processing specifies the operations the panel should apply before displaying the data.  Originally introduced to
    allow for slicing of high-dimensional (high "rank") data sets, this also has a number of operators that are described below.  When the
    component property matches "slice&lt;dim&gt;(&lt;index&gt;)" the slice dimension and transpose gui controls become enabled
    to provide a more usable control for the slice.  For example, turning the mouse wheel over the slice index control will
    rapidly adjust the slice position. (Undock the data tab to see the slices as the adjustment is made.)  Slice dimension controls
    which dimension should be sliced.  Note that the panel will automatically set this when a high dimensional dataset is plotted.
    Transpose will flip the dimensions of the data before plotting.  When a vector component is plotted, component simply identifies
    the component to plot.
</p>

<h3>Additional Operators</h3>
When the component property starts with the pipe (|) character, it is a list of filters that are to be applied to the data.  These
filters include:

<p><tt>|histogram</tt>  perform an "auto" histogram of the data that automatically sets bins.</p>
<p><tt>|logHistogram</tt> perform the auto histogram in the log space.</p>
<p><tt>|log10</tt> take the base-10 log of the data.</p>
<p><tt>|exp10</tt> plot pow(10,ds)</p>
<p><tt>|slice0(index)</tt> slice the data on the zeroth dimension (often time) at the given index.</p>
<p><tt>|slice1(index)</tt> slice the data on the first dimension at the given index.</p>
<p><tt>|collapse0</tt> average over the zeroth dimension to reduce the dimensionality.</p>
<p><tt>|collapse1</tt> average over the first dimension to reduce the dimensionality.</p>
<p><tt>|transpose</tt> transpose the rank 2 dataset.</p>

<p>These filters can be chained together like so:</p>
<tt>|slice1(10)|histogram</tt>
