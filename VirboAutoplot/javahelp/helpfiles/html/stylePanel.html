<p>The Style panel contains controls for the style of the plotted element.</p>
<p>Autoplot tries to pick reasonable default settings such as 
    data rendering method (series versus spectrogram), but also
    default symbol sizes and connectors.  To further specify how
    a plot should appear, click on the plot element to modify
    its color or symbol, for example, or for spectrograms the colorbar
    (e.g. grayscale vs colors).
</p>
<p>Note that you can set the rendering method and default settings
via the plot context menu, under Plot Style. </p>

<p>Note that all controls are currently visible, and this will
change.</p>
