        <p><small>Editor color control and Export-to-Matlab-files features are coming.  See <a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/643/'>rfe 643</a> and <a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/646/'>rfe 646</a>.
            </small></p>            
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2018a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2018-07-28 r22639):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>orbits files with gaps could not be used with orbit data source
            <li>CreatePngWalk command line has autorangeFlags.
            <li>export-to-CSV uses FORMAT metadata and shows progress as the data is exported.
            <li>1682: CSV editor was adding extraneous question mark, corrections to editor such as column width and column names.
            <li>2007: aggregation of non-time-varying data.
            <li>rte_1148065736: check for bad division with Huge Scatter.
            <li>poor feedback when bundle parameter was used with ascii ("bad parameter: rank2" was indicated).
            <li>binary data source editor uses scrollbars when there are many columns.
            <li>make export data set more consistent between types, calling maybeMkdirs so the folder is created.
            <li>support where CSV column header contains units, like "50 Hz"
            <li>2004: HAPI editor panel would sometimes switch servers, because of thread mishandling.
            <li>completions on Jython variables where constructor is used works again.
            <li>improve error feedback when dataset('6 to 7') was passed into histogram2d, where the argument was a rank 0 enumeration and not a range.
            <li>null pointer with hapi caching corrected.
            <li>export-to-CDF failed when TT2000 data had fill value.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2002: gt(r0ds1,r0ds2) is now supported, avoiding confusion.  Thanks, Kristoff and Ed!
            <li>in pngwalk tool, autorange after loading vap if the autorange flag is set.
            <li>rte 1055121094: exporting ephemeris data to qds, when data column contains format specification.  Thanks fallegrini!
            <li>tweak formatting used when printing numbers in metadata tab.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>when index lists are used to access high-rank dataset, check that all lists have the same length.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2001: CDAWeb skips over 1-record CDF files to avoid bug where time-varying DEPEND_1 is lost.
            <li>With CDAWeb, when DEPEND_1 was time-varying, incorrect warning message about length mismatch is no longer shown.
            <li>corrections to new expandToFillGaps filter.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII editor panel would incorrectly set depend0units.
            <li>support for https das2servers.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>1995: corrections to code which aggregates qstreams containing nominal data.
            <li>1996: correction to caching code which would fail to unload data from memory to hard disk, causing out-of-memory exceptions.
            <li>rte_0761821100: CDF gui attempts to clarify error message about rank 2 DEPEND_0.  Swap description of parameter when X or Y tab is selected.
            <li>drop the render type property when param[:,0] is read.
            <li>minor tweaks to HAPI GUI, to improve transparency.
            <li>output console's click-on URL is too easy to trigger, causing confusion.  Make double click.
            <li>GUI logger would get extraneous events because of Autoplot printing thread.  Check for these and log with lower verbosity.
            <li>1994: orbit timerange could not be used as the default timerange in scripts, because it would not recognize the correctly formatted time.
            <li>1987: remove incorrect warning about width and height parameters used with -v in AutoplotServer.
            <li>AutoplotDataServer hapi-csv response is now properly streamed.
            <li>FormatDataSet properly trims HAPI responses, used by AutoplotDataServer.
            <li>1861: back off automatic conversion until Jython 2.5 is used, Java 2.2 is too aggressive in using the conversion and old scripts were breaking.
            <li>format to CDF properly supports rank 2 depend 1 and supports rank 4 data.
            <li>HAPI export format properly formats to HAPI 2.0, which requires "Z" in timetags.
            <li>1871: recent entries of timeranges and operations were lost because of new code that appends the recent file using a move.
            <li>use ISO-8859-1 encoding with Jython output, so that micro symbol paints properly.
            <li>1988: link command, used all over the place, would always copy Z when link(x,y,Z) was used, wasting tons of space...
            <li>1989: msec vs ms in testing.  Canonical units (e.g. ms) are always displayed.
            <li>"degrees" and "Degrees" are now equivalent.  
            <li>1987: revisit height and width parameters of AutoplotServlet.  Thanks, Jon!
            <li>horizontal slicer is now able to "plot above", though there is no way to swap out the label.
            <li>export to HAPI (and AutoplotServlet HAPI output) is properly marked as 2.0.
        </ul>
