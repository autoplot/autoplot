        <p><small>Binary reader is used with character format (%c) to find strings within a CDF file.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions, and run off of ci-pw build server: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-10-28 r26156):</p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2401/">2401</a>: never replace a saved .jy script with a .jyds. Thanks George and Sadie!
            <li>simplifyScript wouldn't handle subscripts properly, causing runtime error when completions were triggered.
            <li>Canvas Size GUI on style tab cleaned up, so manual size can be entered in inches or centimeters.
            <li>Jython script trace run (where it executes line by line for debugging) handles multi-line strings.

            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2400/">2400</a>: white-line-on-white-plot still draws to support when a contrasting color is under the plot.  Thanks, Ali!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2400/">2400</a>: manual ticks ignored the minor ticks in "1,5/2,3,4,6,7,8,9".  Thanks, Ali!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2399/">2399</a>: invalid timerange got into history causing confusion.

            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2394/'>2394</a>: IDL reader properly reads in array of strings and structure data following a string array.  Thanks, Lindsay!
            <li>IDL reader support completions are corrected so automatic GUI is fixed.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2391/'>2391</a>: Jython dataset setItem was overly cautious in its check for units, seriously degrading performance. Thanks, Bill!
            <li>correction to where datum having units is assigned to dimensionless dataset in Jython.
            <li>Jython scripts encoded in UTF-8 with non-breaking spaces are handled now by replacing with normal spaces.  Thanks, Cindy!

            <li>revert log/lin ticks logic, which is needing more time than available.
            <li>"regex mode" for ASCII table parser would clear the units, limiting capabilities.

        </ul>
