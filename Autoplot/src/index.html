            <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and HAPI servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2023a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions, and run off of ci-pw build server: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2023-02-21 r26937):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/48">0048</a>: FFTPower cadence changes are supported with no translation.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/48">0048</a>: correct where new code broke test for cadence change in FFTPower.  Thanks, Keith!
            <li>Corrections to directory listings with GitHubFileSystem.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2507">2507</a>: bug where ASCII reader would return data in different scheme with headers but no data.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/47">0047</a>: anchor type "plot" definition, underscore border type.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/1696">1696</a>: automatically anchor annotation to canvas when plot is specified.
            <li>fftPower has branch were factor of 4 was used where factor of 2 was appropriate.  Thanks, Keith!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2506">2506</a>: CDAWeb reader didn't handle multi-variable reads when virtual variables are used.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>corrections to HAPI server associated with non-ASCII unicode characters.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/795/">rfe795</a>corrections to identifyContinuousBlocks. Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>tweak where statistics are run on large datasets, which was causing pause before display.  Run large dataset stats in the background.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2504">2504</a>: loading a .vap with duplicate IDs results in very weird behavior.  Thanks, Bill!
            <li>handle when getParam is called with the same parameter name twice, dialog is now resizable.
            <li>"if(len(r_erg))" was included in simplified Jython script, causing runtime error.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2501">2501</a>: clean up the X and Y parts of the CDF editor dialog, so that only compatible Xs and Ys are offered. don't allow EwEw&X=EwEw, etc.
            <li>rte_1865701214: strange and annoying RTE associated with setting the status bar text.  Thanks, Bill!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2023-01-21 r26875):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correction to nominal units handling, where nominal datums are now sorted alphabetically, but old code still sorted by creation order.  Thanks Jean-Marc!
            <li>correction to trace mode, where Jython code is broken up into individual commands and executed one-by-one.
            <li>annotation command uses row and column from identified plot.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2497/">2497</a>: Allow trivial calculations, such as "PWD+..." to be in getParam calls.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2496/">2496</a>: track down where order preceding units conversion can affect result of conversion by a trivial amount, which might be amplified in testing.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/793/'>793</a>: swe19970812.nc?Time was broken because the non-digit whitespace was needed for the logic.
            <li>Image render type autorange detects log spacing in axes.
            <li>NetCDF/HDF files can contain formatted ISO8601 again.
            <li>vap+hapi:http://amda.irap.omp.eu/service/hapi?id=ace-epam-ca60&amp;parameters=Time,ace_epam_ca60_he&amp;timerange=2022-06-16 showed where kernel-rebinner wasn't expecting a bins dataset.
            <li>bug with das2server when "vap+das2server:" was entered, as with File->Add Plot From->Das2Server.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2490/">2491</a>: plot( uri, timerange, monitor ) is supported.
            <li>RTEs are sent to cottagesystems.com, not jfaden.net, to work around SSL certificate issue.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2490/">2490</a>: renderType propagates though binary operations, because histogram vanish would dissappear when divided.
            <li>corrections to parsing of "|histogram(2022-09-29T08:36:00Z,2022-09-29T10:07:00Z,1 min )" which supported spaces in some places but not others.
            <li>correction to change which broke completions for "ds=getDataSet('https://&lt;C&gt;')"
            <li>don't paint the DasAxis when the initial resize hasn't happened.
            <li>Remove redundant "range" and "scale" label from undo list.  Correction to where undo wasn't kept.

        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AutoplotDataServer has new usecache=false parameter.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>AutoplotDataServer HAPI info response will set startDate and stopDate when they look reasonable, CDAWeb data source sets these based on all.xml.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>Improvements to the Autoplot servlet, after seeing modern JavaScripts needed corrections to the code.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/796/">796</a>: improve support for second timerange parameter.  Thanks, Sadie!
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AsciiParser has new methods for parsing data within a string, useful for scripts with an in-line calibration table.

            <li>ScriptGUIServlet uses new TimeUtil.js to properly handle next/previous.
