        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-03-28 r25653):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HAPI 2.0 JSON no-data response is supported.
            <li>Grabbing ctrl+C or cmd+C on Mac is difficult, so just make "C" trigger copy to clipboard.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-03-25 r25652):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2324: check the number of bytes transferred over HTTP against what was expected.  Thanks, Jon N.!
            <li>2320: getDeltaPlusMinus carelessly checked variable lengths, so 48x48 dataset DELTA_PLUS triggered a bug.  Thanks, Jon N.!
            <li>2323: consider timetags cadence when picking resolution for display of timetags in metadata tab.  Thanks, Jolene and Larry!
            <li>bugfix: lanlNNSpectrogram's use of samePopulation would crash if ds1 or ds2 was constant, causing "width is zero" message.
            <li>2321: correction to Webstart release, was not properly updated after PDS4 file introduction.  Thanks, Darrell and Пользователь!
            <li>mechanism for identifying Javadoc version used by each package was slow, so redo it so that each jar IDs version just once.
            <li>GitLabs support handles space-physics/juno/ap-script/-/blob/, where three path elements are found before.
            <li>change "failure #2 to deal with another day" message to fine, as it apparently doesn't cause any problems.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>QDataSet FORMAT can now have time templates like $Y-$m-$dT$H:$M:$S for times.
            <li>PDS Data Source gets labels from the XML.
            <li>check cadence when displaying timetags, and use more digits to show cadence.  Thanks, Jolene and Larry!
            <li>improvements to Jython completions allows variable completions on assignments to functions.
            <li>GitLabs support checks for login redirect and throws meaningful error message.
            <li>expose DasAxis labelOffset property, since it is useful to the scientists.
            <li>refactor zip support to treat .kmz files as zip files, more to come.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
