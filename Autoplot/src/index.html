        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2017a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2018-05-16 r22437):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1988: link command, used all over the place, would always copy Z when link(x,y,Z) was used, wasting tons of space...
            <li>"degrees" and "Degrees" are now equivalent.  
            <li>1861: in Jython, rank 0 data can be used as a double automatically.  Thanks, Ed!
            <li>1987: revisit height and width parameters of AutoplotServlet.  Thanks, Jon!
            <li>horizontal slicer is now able to "plot above", though there is no way to swap out the label.

            <li>rte_1578811180: "Getting started" dialog was missing image resource since package renamimg.  Thanks, Dapit!
            <li>Pngwalk's resizeImage code doesn't resize if the dimensions don't change, which happens often.
            <li>"Run Batch" didn't handle URL-type parameters correctly.
            <li>rte_0176698267: mishandling of URIs in new JythonExtensionDataSource.  Thanks, Larry!
            <li>1984: error in inspecting .vap file would clear the address bar, destroying the scientist's URI.
            <li>rte_0395859275: whoops, new code in branch was never tested for "/home/jbf/&lt;TAB&gt;" where NullPointerException was encountered.
            <li>rfe 545: entries for resourceURI were incorrectly used to create the current directory.
            <li>format to QStream supports events data sets.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JythonEditorPanel resource URI file chooser will restrict the extension listed based on the example resource URI.
            <li>about:plugins report is sorted alphabetically.

            <li>downloadResourceAsTempFile supports user:pass in URLs.
            <li>1981: sequence where histogram operation should have unbound the timeaxis.
            <li>tweak the logic for autorange hints "center" and "width"
            <li>rte_1634285758: NullPointerException when annotation is added when a connector (context overview) is visible.
            <li>run batch tool resourceURI argument list generation initial directory is improved.
            <li>format the channel labels for array of vectors when exporting to CDF.
            <li>1897: allow some, but not all, plots to autorange when creating pngwalks.
            <li>1672: annotations were triggering a repaint, so it was repainting continuously.
            <li>formatDataSet command checks for prefix so that the extension can be different than the format.
            <li>yaxis switch mishandled in image data source, units can now be non-dimensionless.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>1975: route to generate hang in export for new users because "/..." was default filename, not "file:/..."  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>more tweaks to the Mashup tool where drag source is considered when replacing child node.
            <li>bugfix with completions, RTE when tot=nn[0]*nn[1] was used and nn not properly culled.
            <li>1956: limit off-screen drawing of event bars, which can result in PDFs which don't import well into MS Word.  Thanks, Bill!
            <li>"now" supported in low-level parse time.  Before only application-level parsers would handle this.
            <li>Annotation has URL property, to avoid text="http://..." kludge and allow text to be used to document web address.
            <li>FileUtil.fileCopy of A to A would destroy the contents of A!
            <li>PNGWalkTool's make HTML would fail miserably when the result was written to the same folder as the pngwalk.
            <li>1973: experiment with clearing the focus URI when script or .vap is run.
            <li>1972: "reset" method cancels all the tasks it knows about.
            <li>mashup starts with "ds" for the first tree, so that is valid.
