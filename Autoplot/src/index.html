        <p><small>Bug in IDLSav reader corrected, where structure containing array of strings or the data following could not be read.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions, and run off of ci-pw build server: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-10-04 r26078):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2394/'>2394</a>: IDL reader properly reads in array of strings and structure data following a string array.  Thanks, Lindsay!
            <li>IDL reader support completions are corrected so automatic GUI is fixed.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2391/'>2391</a>: Jython dataset setItem was overly cautious in its check for units, seriously degrading performance. Thanks, Bill!
            <li>correction to where datum having units is assigned to dimensionless dataset in Jython.
            <li>Jython scripts encoded in UTF-8 with non-breaking spaces are handled now by replacing with normal spaces.  Thanks, Cindy!
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/1028/'>1028</a>: ds[x,y,z] where x y and z are rank 1 list of indices didn't allow negative indices.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2390/'>2390</a>: correction to logic for copy plot elements down, which would break in some cases.  Thanks, Allison!
            <li>layout tab list of plot elements wouldn't repaint when the legend label was changed.
            <li>revert log/lin ticks logic, which is needing more time than available.
            <li>"regex mode" for ASCII table parser would clear the units, limiting capabilities.
            <li>Corrections to add plots and fix layout.  Now only plots attached to the marginColumn are used for the layout.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-07-06 r25854):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2386/'>2386</a>: case where SortDataSet didn't support empty list to index empty dataset.
            <li>default setting of "add plots" dialog should be "below current" to minimize changes.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2385/">2385</a>: question marks in all.xml meant multiple things weren't plottable.
            <li>Ivar pointed out that draw grid caused lineplots to have transparency to them.  Thanks Ivar!
            <li>Remove temporarily use http for runtime errors, not https, since jfaden.net https certificate is fixed.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2383/">2383</a>: exception reports and about menu show launch mechanism used.
            <li>"fix layout" will also remove gaps horizontally when multiple columns are used.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Temporarily use http for runtime errors, not https, since jfaden.net https certificate is broken.
            <li>triple quoted strings would always move the lastLine pointer, sometimes preventing the GUI creation from the address bar.
            <li>Ephemeris lines are limited to 32 lines, was 10.  Thanks, James!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2378/">2378</a>: add setDepend0Cadence, setDepend1Cadence, and setValidRange so these are accessible in scripts.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>round of Findbugs cleanup to get down to 80 flagged issues.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2380/">2380</a>: Correction to append, used with aggregation, when "where" is used with rank 2 CDF datasets.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li>Safety check on putProperty UNITS on FDataSet for TimeLocationUnits didn't consider that None (null) is a valid setting.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Vertical Spectrogram Averager was broken for the rank 2 (Z[X,Y]) case.
        </ul>
