            <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and HAPI servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into one uniform data model.  Data are 
           then displayed by determining the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a useful display with interactive axes and
           mouse actions.  The data can then be further processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting 
           provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2024a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is required.
        </p>

        <p>To run on 32-bit systems, use the single-jar release and a 32-bit version of Java.</p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2024-01-11 r27504):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe811: "Break into stack of plots" action would hang because of mishandling of locks.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>PDS3 looks for both INVALID_CONSTANT and MISSING CONSTANT.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2554/">2554</a>: tweaks to the Run Batch GUI, and improvements to feedback, results file for multi-thread runs.
            <li>corrections to pending results file in Run Batch Tool.
            <li>Exceptions occurring during Mashup tool loading variables now correctly throw Java exception (FileNotFound), not PyException.
            <li>HAPI time ranges requested with millisecond precision, after we noticed truncating milliseconds would cause requests from https://vires.services/hapi to fail because of startDate.
            <li>HAPI data requests with "Time" as the first parameter should always load the time, regardless of its name.
            <li>binAverageBundle checks for dimensionless and degrees, don't do sloppy logic which assumes degrees were intended, since radians are often represented as dimensionless.
            <li>binAverageBundle mishandled ylog bins, adding the linear half-bin not the log half-bin, causing out of bounds.
            <li>Corrections to Das2Server parameters GUI, thanks Chris!
            <li>RunBatch had code which assumed min and max values were both the same type (not 0,4.5).
            <li>fftPower had branch which assumed xtags had units.
            <li>suppress useless "not supported: block" message on stderr.
            <li>Always use edit annotation, even for new annotations.
            <li>Updates to the edit annotation dialog, including anchorType="plot".
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2023-12-15 r27428):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2554/">2554</a>: echo the number of records written to the pending results file.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/47">47</a>: annotation properly clips when splitAnchorType is used.
            <li>Bugfix for completions when reading an IDLSav file, internal cache didn't reset.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2573/">2573</a>: annotation didn't properly listen to the ACTIVEDATASET property and would fail to update %{CONTEXT}.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2571/">2571</a>: detect when channel names are inconsistent where subsampling channels is not desirable.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2570/">2570</a>: fix annotation when pointAt is used
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/1507/">1507</a>: copy and paste plots via clipboard gets the x-axis wrong.
            <li>PngWalkTool address bar records .pngwalk files in its history.
            <li>NetCDF data editor panel didn't update description as X and Y parameters were selected.  
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2567/">2567</a>: correct loaded vaps where column has marginRow as parent, which happened for years but wasn't noticed.  Thanks, Connor!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2567/">2567</a>: where text property wasn't re-bound after the plotId changed.  Thanks, Connor!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2567/">2567</a>: clipping of the ephemeris labels.  Thanks, Connor!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2556/">2556</a>: march through the stack trace looking for lines to annotate.  Introduce new purple error squiggle to indicate some uncertainty in the location.
            <li>rte_0611117604: sloppy code with X and Y in editor.  Thanks, Connor!
            <li>Correct where Ops.java had references to JSON but shouldn't have.  This is handled in the calling code now, where Jython dictionaries are converted to maps for QDataSet.  
            <li>expandToFillGaps doesn't assume that timetags are monotonic now, when finding shortest interval.  Thanks, George!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/86">86</a>: longTitles property would miscalculate width when yaxis was on right.  Thanks, James!
            <li>Don't treat %Y the same as $Y.  Reserve percents for Python string formatting.
            <li>Improvements and bugfixes with Jython to Java converter.
