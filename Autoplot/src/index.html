        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/363/'>rfe363</a>: bug where line was included in simplify for completions, but shouldn't have been, which caused completions to fail.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2425'>2425</a>: fill-to-zero mode with 691200 points showed that reduced version wasn't used.
            <li>bugfix: color scatter mode didn't listen to the log property of the colorbar.  Thanks, Sadie!

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2419">2419</a>: only use this logic for http and https, since jar:... may be used to load files from within the jar.  
            <li>new code to allow internal tests to have short names caused URIs with spaces to break.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2420">2420</a>: Verify that <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/">CVE-2021-44228</a> does not affect Autoplot.
