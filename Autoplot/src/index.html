            </small></p>
            <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and HAPI servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2023a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions, and run off of ci-pw build server: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2023-03-22 r27000):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Das2Stream to QDataSet reader would fail when packet descriptors would introduce a join dimension.
            <li>HAPI export flattens rank 2 data export to support use with prototype servers.
            <li>rte_0373978553: show nice error message when entered time range width is zero.  Thanks, trunali1131!
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2514/">2514</a>: exporting data with append won't append DEPEND_0 if it looks like it's already in there.
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2514/">2514</a>: depend0 units dialog has gray prompt when empty.
            <li>formatDataSet inspect URI action would RTE when carot was after the last character
            <li>rte_0008993657: runtime error with ExpandToFillGaps editor when no DEPEND_0 is found.  Thanks, George!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2023-03-03 r26979):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>small and trivial FindBugs cleanup.
            <li>isUniformRatioMetricCadence (10% increase) will not return true when the data is not ratio data.
            <li>ytitle position was shifted twice when axisOffset was used.  Thanks, James!
            <li>untested branch in newRange when min>max, which is new code.  It now swaps the values as indicated in the documentation.
            <li>rank 2 spectrograms which also had a BUNDLE_1 was treated as a bundle, which is the case for datasets just to label channels.
            <li>Corrections to completions for IDLSave source and for its automatically-generated GUI control.
            <li>Spectrogram binAverage and nearestNeighbor modes will use rank 0 BIN_PLUS and other codes to do a better job of establishing cadence.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2501">2501</a>:Corrections to CDF editor panel and completions.  
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2501">2501</a>:CDF with X= would show the wrong label for X.
            <li>IDLSave X= and Y= parameters properly match the xunits parameter.
            <li>IDLSave files support unsigned longs, as long as they don't use the high bit.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2506">2506</a>: recent change to CDAWeb to allow multiple variable selections didn't consider non-virtual variables.  Thanks, Dante!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/48">0048</a>: Finally FFTPower translation is handled properly, where a second bug associated with translation was hiding in plain sight.  Thanks, Keith!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/798/'>798</a>: preserve x-axis range when changing operations, only autoranging Y for "|multiply(5)".  Thanks, Cindy!
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DasPlot long titles property and debug bounds.
            <li>HAPI source shows prompt in search dialog.
            <li>reform( ds, nrec, qube ) now copies DEPEND_0 when first dimension length doesn't change
            <li>nearestNeighbor rebinner will use rank 0 BIN_PLUS and BIN_MINUS to set the width. Thanks, Jon N!
            <li>When generating GUIs based on completions, put the "arg_0" completion at the top, since it is important.
            <li>IDLSav supports float and double complex numbers.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/797/">797</a>: BinaryDataSource URIs can now have control dims=[64,48].
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/797/">797</a>: https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/797/BinaryDataSource URIs can now allow simple calculations including * and +, for example rank2=0:48*64.
            <li>IDLSav supports ulongs (type 15), as long as the ulongs don't use the highest bit.  Thanks, Cindy!
        </ul>
