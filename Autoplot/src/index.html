        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions: <a href="autoplot.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-06-30 r25825):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>export from slicer allow Autoplot to format the data, but the options were ignored.  Thanks, George!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2363">2363</a>: ASCII file with X and Y arguments still didn't work because I forgot to commit a bit of code.
            <li>detect two question marks in .jyds URIs, which has a confusing result, and print a warning for now.
            <li>Das2Server source didn't allow single channels of ephemeris source to be selected from older Das2 Servers.  Thanks, Sadie!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-06-22 r25825):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2363">2363</a>: NetCDF source supports capitalized X for consistency, and just X and Y arguments.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2363">2363</a>: ASCII source supports just X and Y arguments, as well as X,Y and Z.  CDF supports capitalized X for consistency.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2361">2361</a>: CDAWeb virtual variables properly implement data[:,3].  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/16">0016</a>: check for roundoff error when exporting to das2stream from horizontal slicer "dump data" action.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2359/">2359</a>: .vap.zip control added for embedding data which is already available over http.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>suppress double question mark URI warning for vap+jyds arguments.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>don't print empty field warning when the last field is the empty field.  This happens often when exporting .csv's from spreadsheets.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/14">0014</a>: for 2-dataset bundle of startTime and stopTime, don't use the last dataset (stopTime) as the data attached to each event.  This confuses the automatic choosing of renderType.
            <li>new mime types in jnlp files.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2357/">2357</a>: script editor clears old script filename before using editor to display "loading" message, since it was possible to clobber the old script.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2354/">2354</a>: gaps in pngwalk sequence incorrectly marked for orbit files.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/12">0012</a>: series render data reduction can make all data invalid.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2352">2352</a>: cache MONOTONIC=FALSE, before we would only cache MONOTONIC=TRUE, but determining it is false can be expensive for some data.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>don't mark the Jython variable "_" as unread, so that it can be used in loops to assert that the loop variable is not used.
            <li>remove old warning when das2stream used something besides Units.us2000 for timetags, this was fixed years ago.  Thanks, Chris!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>added Units.us1970, microseconds since 1970.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>within and without allow second argument to be a list of events (not just a single event), so that a script can easily remove a set of events.  Thanks Ivar!
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/743/'>743</a>: Initial support for NetCDF files at CDAWeb, including Formosat-5 files.  Thanks, Bobby!
            <li>ephemerisLabels property of each plot allows the ephemeris channels to be manually labeled.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>normalize(ds,1) function added so you can normalize along an index.  Thanks, Kristoff!
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
            <li>Bugs often have a four-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/&lt;ID&gt;/.  
            <li>Features typically have a three-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/&lt;ID&gt;/.
        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
