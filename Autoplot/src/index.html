        <p><small>Studying Scatter performance with the goal of removing the confusing Huge Scatter mode.
            </small></p>            
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2018a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2018-08-25 r22735):</p>

            <li>2022: minor clean-up in layout listener changes support, where one path would fail to see a change was still pending.  (Bug 1022 lingers)
            <li>Dan fixed Java 9 ambiguity with Class Module.
            <li>2017: bug where weights with incorrect rank would cause RTE on event thread, and replicate properly handles WEIGHTS now.

            <li>confusing error message for dr[indgen(4)]=findgen(5), make more precise.  Loosen test slightly, See "svn log -r22709:22710"
            <li>FileSystem's unzip action now handles where NetCDF .jar file had missing files, issuing warning instead of crashing.

            <li>corrections to "trim" filter GUI.
            <li>rte 276343956: transitional case in "isSomeoneListening" caused RTE.  Make local copies for thread safety.

            <li>Matlab and IDL export methods check for non-qubes.
            <li>2007: aggregation of non-time-varying data.  More issues found with single-record waveform files.
            <li>javadoc popup in Jython editor was using old javadoc.
            <li>HAPI uses server_list.txt now instead of all.txt.
            <li>binAverage reduction method used old QDataSet form which is no longer used (indexed property vs slice then property).
            <li>rte_0183234259: Corrections to Das2Server authentication dialog, such as NullPointerException and allow scientist to opt out when password is not known.
            <li>rte 1924252302: "display data" mouse action correctly uses format specifiers found in data.
            <li>SeriesRenderer, when data breaks exist on both sides of a valid point, would fail to draw the point.
            <li>1999: correct error message in ASCII when non-existent column is requested.
            <li>new data set builder nextRecords function had a bug where 0th record was always copied.  Thanks, Ivar!

            <li>export-to-CSV uses FORMAT metadata and shows progress as the data is exported.
            <li>1682: CSV editor was adding extraneous question mark, corrections to editor such as column width and column names.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rte_1148065736: check for bad division with Huge Scatter.
            <li>poor feedback when bundle parameter was used with ascii ("bad parameter: rank2" was indicated).
            <li>binary data source editor uses scrollbars when there are many columns.
            <li>make export data set more consistent between types, calling maybeMkdirs so the folder is created.
            <li>support where CSV column header contains units, like "50 Hz"
            <li>2004: HAPI editor panel would sometimes switch servers, because of thread mishandling.
            <li>completions on Jython variables where constructor is used works again.
            <li>improve error feedback when dataset('6 to 7') was passed into histogram2d, where the argument was a rank 0 enumeration and not a range.
            <li>null pointer with hapi caching corrected.
            <li>export-to-CDF failed when TT2000 data had fill value.  Thanks, Ivar!
