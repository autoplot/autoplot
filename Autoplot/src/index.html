        <p><small>X Axis' new "tickValues" property used to nicely locate ticks in angles space.
            </small></p>            
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2019a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available.

            <li>URI_Template's phasestart modifier was never implemented.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>2158: setItemAllLists( rank0, rank0, rank1) now reconciles the three properly.  Thanks, Bill!
            <li>2155: automatically set digitizer "sorted" property so that pixel locations don't clobber each other.
            <li>TITLE property was printed twice in ASCII export.
            <li>2133: bug in Datum.Long to TimeStruct, where leap seconds were handled incorrectly, was corrected.  Thanks, Darrell!
            <li>%{TIMERANGE} macro can convert back to orbit number.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2154: support assignment of fill to dataset, where fill is copied or translated to the dataset's fill value.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>bug with new --quiet switch with AutoplotDataServer corrected.  
            <li>1670: check for weight=0 with value=NaN, some codes assumed weight*value was valid.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2148: shift-execute correctly brings up the parameters dialog in the script editor.
            <li>2148: .jy scripts now get lint to check for common mistakes, before just .jyds scripts did.
            <li>check for duplicate entries in CDAWeb file-finding service.  This is a bug they will fix as well.
            <li>2140: top and bottom painters are automatically antialiased and have their own graphics context to protect other parts of the plot.
            <li>2140: add support for DasPlot top and bottom decorators.
            <li>2147: data reduction with series renderer and small pixels would result in washed-out image.
            <li>2146: autolayout incorrectly reclaims room for TCAs, adding noise to vap loading.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li>doDataSetReduce of SeriesRenderer now reduces to 1/2 pixel, so that "1px" sized black dots appear black.
            <li>performance improvements to the HugeScatterRenderer.
            <li>2145: avoid infinite loop in Events List when there are no events in the next intervals.

            <li>performance improvements with new Das2Stream reader, along minor bugs pointed out by Jenkins tests.
            <li>clean up old script examples in https://svn.code.sf.net/p/autoplot/code/autoplot/trunk/Autoplot/src/scripts/
            <li>2143: HAPI client respects dataset time boundaries when caching is enabled.
            <li>rebinner API now passes information about the Z axis so interpolation can be fixed.
            <li>"polar" render type corrects units.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>findbugs suggestions.
            <li>2138: when using X,Y,Z feature of CDF editor, Y metadata shown initially, not the Z data.
            <li>2127: code which appended virtual records on CDF variables which were too short didn't consider virtual variables.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li>0875: old branch was using aggregated URI in getDataSourceEditorPanel, causing bogus hit to remote servers.
            <li>fall back to two columns when column count cannot be guessed with ASCII files, so that the editor shows the file instead of nothing.
            <li>2137: support for decimal years.
            <li>1629: NullPointerException in code which would verify Jython index.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>2136: when initial load results in "no data" still support TSB.  Thanks, Baptiste and Chris!
            <li>orbits file would use old http, not https locations.
            <li>2103: tick layout is done using floats, so that pdf output has uniform ticks.
            <li>1678: bind with the plot colorbar the source so that the new plotElements have to comply.
            <li>2133: detect LongReadAccess when CDF_TT2000 is used for timetags, so that CDF timetags can be formatted to ASCII with full resolution.  Thanks, Eric!
            <li>2036: keep track of the parent of the monitor used for centering, after seeing that the hidden monitor would position properly when it becomes visible.
