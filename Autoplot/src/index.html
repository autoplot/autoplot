        <p><small>Experimental testing of new warnings, like when result of where is used on array of different length.  See <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/rfe/sf/737/indices.jy'>indices.jy</a>.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-02-06 r25519):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Script editor USAGES should be green, not yellow, so that yellow can be used for warnings.
            <li>Jython positional parameters were in the wrong location, where arg_1 is the first argument, not arg_0.
            <li>correction to ASCII file parsing, where minor bugfix broke things for more common use.
            <li>clarify security warning that the scientist has run a particular script version already.
            <li>fix old off-by-one errors in DasAxis and DasPlot codes, producing a cleaner output.
            <li>ASCII files where header is parsed as data would cause noise as incorrect error was printed.
            <li>clarify documentation for synchronizeNN that dss must each have monotonic timetags.
            <li>rte 472115488: NetCDF editor panel had a path where positional parameter could end up null, causing RTE.  Thanks, Shing!
            <li>Run Batch "Load From File" action uses open dialog, not save dialog.
            <li>"slices" filter GUI would reset improperly when the string was edited, causing flickering and occasional failure.  Thanks, Shing!
            <li>correction to support for CDF file psp_fld_l2_mag_RTN_1min[:,0];psp_fld_l2_mag_RTN_1min[:,1];psp_fld_l2_mag_RTN_1min[:,2], where slice is not implemented.  Thanks, Jon N!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2020-12-29 r25415):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>improve transparency of local files used with ro_cache.txt, where local files can be used to resolve remote files.
            <li>1310: --sandbox mode with "open vap file" now works on a Mac, which checked to see if the read-only folder was writable.
            <li>1687: scripts with first line was a multi-line setScriptDescription couldn't be run from the address bar.
            <li>1310: --sandbox command line option limits writes to ~/AUTOPLOT_DATA and /tmp.
            <li>2309: correction to DataPointRecorder when reading a file.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>always support "~/..." as a shortcut for home directory.
            <li>2309: correction to DataPointRecorder units change when emptied.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>1779: copy/paste plot is more aggressive about trying to bind the pasted plot's x-axis to the timerange.  Thanks, Bill!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add sortInTime function which sorts the data based on DEPEND_0.
            <li>737: VALID_MAX is used to hint when result of where is used on the wrong array.
            <li>737: issue warning when real numbers are used to index an array.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>737: introduce static analysis of scripts.
            <li>OppositeAxisVisible property requests that axes be drawn on both sides of the plot.  Thanks, Bill!
            <li>Orbit plot tickStyle control allows ticks to be drawn on both sides of line.  Thanks, Bill!
            <li>Units.nominal() introduced to avoid explicit use of EnumerationUnits: print Units.nominal().createDatum('Chicago')
            <li>rfe681: handle 404 when creating filesystem where filesystem does not exist.  404 will return an error immediately, while 403 is allowed, assuming there will be no listing requested.
            <li>das2 DasAxis and DasPlot have new opaqueBackground property, to study handling of label collisions.
            <li>new whereSequence command quickly finds sequences occurring in rank 1 datasets, for use with file magic numbers.
            <li>SpaseDataSource refactored to XMLDataSource delegate, to make way for improved PDS support.
            <li>BufferDataSet now has AsciiDataSet, for numbers encoded within binary source using ASCII, useful with PDS data.
            <li>rank0 labelsDataSet command should be used where old code would use dataset('Chicago'), which was allowed briefly.
            <li>Run Batch now keeps track of the last file location (preference) with "Load From File" action, speeding up repeated runs.
            <li>add rank 4 link command.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add --macUseScreenMenuBar, which uses a conventional screen menu bar on Macs.
            <li>rebundle command allows subsetting and resorting of bundle datasets.
            <li>support datumRange(5,10) in scripts.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>events bar supports lineStyle and lineThick properties, new opaque property disables default transparency.  Thanks, Ali!
            <li>getFile can have null passed in for the monitor, when the developer knows the load will be quick.
        </ul>

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
