        <p><small>Export data from a slicer correctly formats to time resolution specified, and script "createDataPointRecorder" command allows the data to be exported into many formats.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-08-17 r25944):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vertical Spectrogram Averager was broken for the rank 2 (Z[X,Y]) case.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-07-06 r25854):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BinaryDataSource throws a more actionable error message when it is instructed to read past the end of a file.
            <li>.sps and .spd Jython extensions moved from server at U. Iowa to <a href="https://github.com/autoplot/scripts/tree/master/formats/sps">GitHub</a>
            <li>timerange completions corrected for CDAWeb source, to support scripting.
            <li>GitHubFileSystem supports listings from GitHub, before you could only access files if the name was known already.  GitLabs still needs work.
            <li>return type of the function call was sometimes mis-reported in Jython completions, as in convertUnitsTo.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2376/'>2376</a>: some of the set item methods in Jython mishandled the units.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Unpushed change which caused a bug in the ASCII reader was pushed unknowingly and was never tested in last devel release.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2375/">2375</a>: new code to show "add tool" checkbox on script parameters tab broke GUI in one case.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2374/">2374</a>: StaticCodeAnalysis.showUsage corrects incorrect offsets when cos((myvar)) is used, where the double parens show bug in Jython.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Binary data source reportOffset uses T and F now, to match other data sources.
            <li>add @see flattenWaveform to synchronizeNN documentation, since the scientist would typically need to flatten the data first.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Binary data source can read huge binary files (>2GB), though only 2GB at a time.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>Initial Bookmarks GUI would allow the description and title to be modified, even though no bookmark was selected, causing confusion.
            <li>Data Mash-up tool supports "None" as a parameter, allowing "fftPower" function to be used.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2364/">2364</a>: code which closed Autoplot back-end server removed, so that multiple commands can be sent.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2367/">2367</a>: guess time format mistook four-character "time" for $H$M field.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>if series color scatter data zunits were not convertible to colorbar units, the data was not displayed and no warning message was printed.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2369/">2369</a>: ASCII file reader treats non-breaking spaces, from copying data in email, as whitespace.  Thanks, Sadie!

        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DataSetIterator now has getRank0Value and putRank0Value (as well as double access), making it easier to write correct code.
            <li>Custom Jython editor actions now appear one level higher.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/17">17</a>: Support for &lt;b&gt; for bold (&lt;/b&gt; to turn off) and &lt;i&gt; for italics in labels.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>add plots with multiple rows finally supports replace current.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Introduce dom.controller.selectedPlots property.  See <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/demos/tools/layout/joinPlots.jy'>joinPlots.jy</a> for example use.
            <li>Introduce new qubeSubset which will throw out data until the non-qube can be represented as a qube, to assist with the Das2Server.  Thanks, Terry!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/autoplot/documentation/issues/1">1</a>: use "run" where "execute" is unnecessarily used.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
