        <p><small>CDF metadata can be used to indicate nominal and warning ranges.
            </small></p>            
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2018a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2018-07-07 r22563):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>export-to-CDF failed when TT2000 data had fill value.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2002: gt(r0ds1,r0ds2) is now supported, avoiding confusion.  Thanks, Kristoff and Ed!
            <li>in pngwalk tool, autorange after loading vap if the autorange flag is set.
            <li>rte 1055121094: exporting ephemeris data to qds, when data column contains format specification.  Thanks fallegrini!
            <li>tweak formatting used when printing numbers in metadata tab.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>when index lists are used to access high-rank dataset, check that all lists have the same length.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2001: CDAWeb skips over 1-record CDF files to avoid bug where time-varying DEPEND_1 is lost.
            <li>With CDAWeb, when DEPEND_1 was time-varying, incorrect warning message about length mismatch is no longer shown.
            <li>corrections to new expandToFillGaps filter.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII editor panel would incorrectly set depend0units.
            <li>support for https das2servers.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>1995: corrections to code which aggregates qstreams containing nominal data.
            <li>1996: correction to caching code which would fail to unload data from memory to hard disk, causing out-of-memory exceptions.
            <li>rte_0761821100: CDF gui attempts to clarify error message about rank 2 DEPEND_0.  Swap description of parameter when X or Y tab is selected.
            <li>drop the render type property when param[:,0] is read.
            <li>minor tweaks to HAPI GUI, to improve transparency.
            <li>output console's click-on URL is too easy to trigger, causing confusion.  Make double click.
            <li>GUI logger would get extraneous events because of Autoplot printing thread.  Check for these and log with lower verbosity.
            <li>1994: orbit timerange could not be used as the default timerange in scripts, because it would not recognize the correctly formatted time.
            <li>1987: remove incorrect warning about width and height parameters used with -v in AutoplotServer.
            <li>AutoplotDataServer hapi-csv response is now properly streamed.
            <li>FormatDataSet properly trims HAPI responses, used by AutoplotDataServer.
            <li>1861: back off automatic conversion until Jython 2.5 is used, Java 2.2 is too aggressive in using the conversion and old scripts were breaking.
            <li>format to CDF properly supports rank 2 depend 1 and supports rank 4 data.
            <li>HAPI export format properly formats to HAPI 2.0, which requires "Z" in timetags.
            <li>1871: recent entries of timeranges and operations were lost because of new code that appends the recent file using a move.
            <li>use ISO-8859-1 encoding with Jython output, so that micro symbol paints properly.
            <li>1988: link command, used all over the place, would always copy Z when link(x,y,Z) was used, wasting tons of space...
            <li>1989: msec vs ms in testing.  Canonical units (e.g. ms) are always displayed.
            <li>"degrees" and "Degrees" are now equivalent.  
            <li>1987: revisit height and width parameters of AutoplotServlet.  Thanks, Jon!
            <li>horizontal slicer is now able to "plot above", though there is no way to swap out the label.
            <li>export to HAPI (and AutoplotServlet HAPI output) is properly marked as 2.0.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>641: HAPI caching experiment where request is broken up into daily requests so that caching is more effective.
            <li>SeriesRenderer can now be used as a delegate to allow use in scripts.
            <li>More anchor positions, including OutsideS and OutsideSSW, OutsideW.
            <li>DataSetBuilder has new nextRecords function, which accepts multiple records, to avoid confusion caused by use of putValues function.
            <li>U. Iowa group's RangeLabel and CollapseSpectrogramRenderer is now compiled in.
            <li>bug2000: abs now returns units when the data is ratiometric.
            <li>add more positions for annotations, like "West" and OutsideSSE.
            <li>allow no-record DELTA_PLUS, issuing a warning, to aid in development.
            <li>expandToFillGaps process added.
        </ul>

            <li>rfe638: export-to-idlsav supports rank 2 data.  Thanks, cj2g13!
            <li>tweaks to the static html file created for pngwalks, which improves performance over slow networks.
            <li>logspace function added.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>DataServer implemented as servlet to improve performance.  Thanks, Bob!
