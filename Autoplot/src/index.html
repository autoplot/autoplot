        <p><small>USER_PROPERTIES are used to convey custom metadata from data loading to plot, as demonstrated in <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/rfe/sf/426/demo.jyds'>this script</a> and <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/rfe/sf/426/demo.vap'>this vap</a>.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-04-17 r25709):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2338: if an aggregation granule dataset doesn't validate, don't mix it into the aggregation.
            <li>2339: report when noCheckCertificates is set in about and runtime submissions.
            <li>2210: create screenshot hangs on a Mac.
            <li>2335: runtime error with ~/Downloa&lt;T&gt; when Downloads folder contains file with single paren.
            <li>2333: rte1830566714 shows where TCA result can be null and was not handled.
            <li>start to correct Java 7 complaints in QDataSet.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-03-25 r25652):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2332: copy over the data when copying a DOM (.vap), so that 'vap+internal:' data is copied as well.
            <li>2102: fix layout would allocate space even when "displayTitle" is false.
            <li>2329: default button for True/False param is "1" not "True"
            <li>2330: under-implementation of rfe670 rank3 depend2 in slice0.
            <li>SeriesRenderer, when in reduce-data mode, now reduces colors as well, culling a dot which is later covered by another.  Before data would suddenly turn black.
            <li>James caught place where rarely-used code would have been stuck in endless loop.  Thanks James!
            <li>correction to export of qstream, where format is "%.2f", causing runtime error because there was no field width.
            <li>tooltip to evaluate Jython expression properly html-izes output, replacing newlines with &lt;br&gt;.
            <li>HAPI 2.0 JSON no-data response is supported.
            <li>Grabbing ctrl+C or cmd+C on Mac is difficult, so just make "C" trigger copy crosshair coordinates to clipboard.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>installTool correctly sets PWD now, so that it can be used in argument lists
            <li>740: warnings about redefining symbols like "plot" or "total" is too noisy, be more careful to only show when there is a problem.
	    <li>Jython to Java converter improvements.
            <li>739: DasCore moved to GitHub, along with QDataSet
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RecordIterator supports rank 3 depend 2, to support demo data set in HapiServerDemo.
            <li>.batch files for the run batch tool support %{PWD} in script reference, to improve portability.
            <li>add new eventsComplement which returns the intervals which are not in the input.
            <li>tickValues can now be *10/2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or *100 for log axes.  Thanks, Ali!
            <li>Revisit the "Run Batch" dialog, and keep track of stdout for each run.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
            <li>Bugs often have a four-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/&lt;ID&gt;/.

        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
