        <p><small>Run batch tool used to generate new icons for the spectrogram renderer.</small></p>
            <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and HAPI servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into one uniform data model.  Data are 
           then displayed by determining the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a useful display with interactive axes and
           mouse actions.  The data can then be further processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting 
           provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2024a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is required.
        </p>

        <p>To run on 32-bit systems, use the single-jar release and a 32-bit version of Java.</p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2024-02-01 r27533):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>correction to label in Run Batch post-run popup menu.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2576">2576</a>: hopefully fix "Expected DSF to be non-null" message when focus is blurred.
            <li>remove kernalCode spectrogram rebin mode, which shouldn't have been exposed.
            <li>slices on single-screen machines always jumped to pixel coordinates 0,0.
            <li>mkdir function is in a synchronized block, so that multi-thread batch processing don't step on each other's toes.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2024-01-20 r27509):</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>WritableJoinDataSet copy failed when child was also JoinDataSet.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/94">94</a>: Support offline mode with GitHubFileSystem
            <li>rfe811: "Break into stack of plots" action would hang because of mishandling of locks.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>PDS3 looks for both INVALID_CONSTANT and MISSING CONSTANT.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2554/">2554</a>: tweaks to the Run Batch GUI, and improvements to feedback, results file for multi-thread runs.
            <li>corrections to pending results file in Run Batch Tool.
            <li>Exceptions occurring during Mashup tool loading variables now correctly throw Java exception (FileNotFound), not PyException.
            <li>HAPI time ranges requested with millisecond precision, after we noticed truncating milliseconds would cause requests from https://vires.services/hapi to fail because of startDate.
            <li>HAPI data requests with "Time" as the first parameter should always load the time, regardless of its name.
            <li>binAverageBundle checks for dimensionless and degrees, don't do sloppy logic which assumes degrees were intended, since radians are often represented as dimensionless.
            <li>binAverageBundle mishandled ylog bins, adding the linear half-bin not the log half-bin, causing out of bounds.
            <li>Corrections to Das2Server parameters GUI, thanks Chris!
            <li>RunBatch had code which assumed min and max values were both the same type (not 0,4.5).
            <li>fftPower had branch which assumed xtags had units.
            <li>suppress useless "not supported: block" message on stderr.
            <li>Always use edit annotation, even for new annotations.
            <li>Updates to the edit annotation dialog, including anchorType="plot".
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>update das2 spectrogram icons.
            <li>invalid(ds) function added equivalent to valid(ds).eq(0).
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/818/">818</a>: Support for high-rank (multi-index) data PDS3 tables with CONTAINERS.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/818/">818</a>: Support for PDS3 spreadsheets.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>rfe521: introduce aggregation control addDim=T which will force it to aggregation to a dimension, so rank 1 can be added for each day and viewed as spectrogram.  Thanks, Jean-Marc!
            <li>metadata tab shows data with Units.rgbValue as named color if possible.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/819/">819</a>: add polyMesh QDataSet schema, to finish off the things QDataSet was intended to model.
            <li>support for fixed-length fields in ASCII format, including delim=NONE.  Allow comment to be specified.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/818/">818</a>: Initial support for PDS3 labels.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/817/">817</a>: Power Spectral Density and other functions.
            <li>Click on canvas corner to blur focus.
            <li>Write to pngwalk file will add quality control to the save directory, if it is enabled.
        </ul>
