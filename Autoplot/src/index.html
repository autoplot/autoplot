        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions, and run off of ci-pw build server: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2022-02-26 r26510):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detrend and a few other operators were missing descriptions in "add operation" dialog.
            <li>Create PNG walk lock file wasn't deleted when culling no-data images.
            <li>Autoplot server only believes X-Forwarded-For when remote host is from a secure network.
            <li>HapiDataSource didn't provide completions for parameters and timerange.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2022-02-22 r26493):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pressing "run batch" tool cancel button also cancels the running process.
            <li>include jaxb library in stable jars to support Java 12, where this has been removed.  (There are still issues with Java 12 and PDS module.)
            <li>triple-quotes check in Jython getParameters refactorings didn't look for """, only '''.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2435/">2435</a>: careless code assumed that CONTEXT_0 rank 0 data left over from slice1 could be added to calculate timetag
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2433/">2433</a>: $Y$m$d$H$M_to_$(Y;end)$m$d$H$M is allowed in PNG Walks now.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2432/">2432</a>: corrections to decimalYear unit.
            <li>SeriesRenderer handles rgbColor where alpha channel is non-zero.
            <li>script diff since last invocation was drawn backwards, showing changes in the wrong direction.
            <li>Use start and stop for HAPI 3.0 servers.
            <li>Autoplot-based HAPI server properly formats times with Z suffix.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>HAPI data source editor is set properly when there is an error getting the catalog.  Before it would leave an old catalog showing.
            <li>go-to line action from the Jython editor line number gutter now requires shift to activate.
            <li>runtime error during data source editor creation could leave the data set selector in a locked state.
            <li>correction to rescale routine, which ignored the "max" parameter.
            <li>if a data source crashed during GUI initialization, the data set selector could be locked up.
            <li>trace functionality revisited to use Jython AST for handling code.
            <li>Run Batch Tool save action used open dialog, now uses save.
            <li>dataSetWrapper needed to wrap slice and trim methods.
            <li>Recent change to support colors for nominal data in HAPI client broke timetag-only read.
            <li>DataSetBuilder's toString method used * for streaming dimension, when : is consistent with Jython.
            <li>Polar plot handles bundle(angles,radii).
            <li>correctly handle autoranging with the Series renderer and bundle of X,Y.
            <li><a href='https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/26'>0026</a>: clip lines outside of the plot bounds, so that performance is preserved with lines to log(0) a.k.a. -Inf, which was limited to -10000 px.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2429/'>2429</a>: don't do the automatic DEPEND_0 when the column read is column 0.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/651/'>rfe651</a>: orbit:/tmp/orbitsfile.txt:mms-1 is no longer interpreted as range.  This is only supported with numeric orbit numbers.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/651/'>rfe651</a>: pressing the events list green play button will always re-read the events definitions from the file.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Trim whitespace at end of Jython code when showing differences, because on Windows every line was marked as changed on Bill's computer.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/363/'>rfe363</a>: various code fragments (else, subscript, etc) were handled improperly, causing completions to fail.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/363/'>rfe363</a>: bug where line was included in simplify for completions, but shouldn't have been, which caused completions to fail.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2425'>2425</a>: fill-to-zero mode with 691200 points showed that reduced version wasn't used.
            <li>bugfix: color scatter mode didn't listen to the log property of the colorbar.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>some thread use clean up after seeing issues with Java 17.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2424'>2424</a>: set the application when running custom actions in the editor, when working with multiple windows.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2421">2421</a>: add action to show simplified script to get parameters.
            <li>annotation editor dialog now has GrannyTextEditor button.
            <li>GitCommand assumed it could write to /tmp/, which isn't working on a Mac.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/772/">rfe772</a>: The right argument of Run Batch can also have multiple parameters, and GUI reveals the feature.  
            <li>when Jython completions encounters an error when running, still show the completions for other symbols, improve error display.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/774/">rfe774</a>: Completions on URI within getDataSet call supports simple string concatenations to allow for shorter lines without loosing completions.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/772/">rfe772</a>: Run Batch supports list of M arguments.
