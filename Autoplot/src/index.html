        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2017a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>SourceForge has made changes which require special actions in the release process.  Please be aware that this may cause unusual behavior.</p>

        <p>Bugfixes (2018-04-05 r22284):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1975: route to generate hang in export for new users because "/..." was default filename, not "file:/..."
            <li>more tweaks to the Mashup tool where drag source is considered when replacing child node.
            <li>bugfix with completions, RTE when tot=nn[0]*nn[1] was used and nn not properly culled.
            <li>1956: limit off-screen drawing of event bars, which can result in PDFs which don't import well into MS Word.
            <li>"now" supported in low-level parse time.  Before only application-level parsers would handle this.
            <li>Annotation has URL property, to avoid text="http://..." kludge and allow text to be used to document web address.
            <li>FileUtil.fileCopy of A to A would destroy the contents of A!
            <li>PNGWalkTool's make HTML would fail miserably when the result was written to the same folder as the pngwalk.
            <li>1973: experiment with clearing the focus URI when script or .vap is run.
            <li>1972: "reset" method cancels all the tasks it knows about.
            <li>mashup starts with "ds" for the first tree, so that is valid.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JNLP template supports builds on new machines.
            <li>Overzealous check for valid y tags prevented use of MAGEIS data from script.
            <li>rte_1235389582: failed listing in Aggregation GUI caused runtime error.
            <li>setDepend1Cadence filter is properly handled and has a GUI.
            <li>Experimental HAPI caching does not cache after modified date.
            <li>AggregratingDataSource had code branches which misused progress monitors, causing warning message on stderr.
            <li>Mashup was checking for TimeSeriesBrowse, which can rely on web transactions, on the event thread, causing hangs with slow websites.
            <li>pngwalk of file:///home/jbf/ictemp/2018/*/*/ic_*_12.jpg (star multiple levels deep) showed a bug where the filenames were incorrectly handled, resulting in runtime error in Autoplot's pngwalk.
            <li>1899: don't display a warning about units if yaxis units are dimensionless.
            <li>QStream and Das2Stream export split into separate codes.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>1969: MutablePropertyDataSet no longer implies mutable.  Thanks, Jon N.!
            <li>Chris put in support for the Das2Server to support redirects from http to https.
            <li>write animated gif delay times corrected, where delays were 1/10 of what they should have been.
            <li>jython completions will evaluate constructors.  be more aggressive about dropping trailing lines to make a valid code.
            <li>slice editor will look up the index as the time is changed.  
            <li>corrections to mash-up tool, preserving unfolded tree states and where function name was mistaken for variable name.
            <li>1956: horizontal lines were not drawn because bounding box had height=0.  Vertical lines had the same problem.
            <li>1966: runScript which should be called from the event thread, loads the script off the event thread. 
            <li>1600: in history.txt, only log URIs which are human-entered.
            <li>rte_1731551069: filtering with "where" in CDF files, when data has different rank.
            <li>1965: "and" and "or" need to be infix operators in mashup.  Thanks, Allison!

            <li>jython editor has new "run selected" action.
            <li>fix runtime error which could happen when %d was the format.  Some codes didn't check for this and cast the data.
            <li>1947: fix 1-pixel error in colorbar pointed out by Kristoff. (Now it's a half-pixel, but this is a PDF rendering problem.)
            <li>always get the makeTutorialHtml from the website, since release showed there were issues.
            <li>1962: catch strange ConcurrentModificationException when running http://autoplot.org/data/script/examples/plotsAndAnnos2018.jy
            <li>dataset toString method had a branch which would cause RTE when format was %d (integer).

            <li>rte553: property assign units for ds[0,:]=ds1 and ds1 has units and ds does not.
            <li>print a warning when a FloatDataSet is used to store time location data, since this is rarely going to work.
            <li>1959: fix layout doesn't swap plot positions when rows are out-of-order (item 4).
            <li>1956: FCE line which was way off-canvas still affected PDF output, messing up the bounding box.  Thanks, Bill!

            <li>1958: NetCDF library didn't properly handle spaces in filenames.  Thanks, Masafumi!
            <li>1953: Masafumi found cases where rounding was done incorrectly, probably because kludgy code was removed.  Thanks, Masafumi!
            <li>Autoplot server (port 12345) improperly created the Jython environment, breaking plot named parameters.  Thanks, Eric!
            <li>1952: uncommitted changes implementing flag for indexed properties and allowing just AbstractDataSet to handle properties.

            <li>1952: reimplement isInheritedProperty to avoid so much string searching with slice operations.
            <li>extent code used isMonotonicAndIncreasingQuick, when new isMonotonicQuick is sufficient.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>1952: rewrite within(), used in huge scatter, to dramatically improve performance.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>1952: "where" uses bigger blocksize for 5000000 record operation, showing modest (20-30%) speed improvements.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>direct access of longs from CDF file was never verified, now it's correct.
            <li>rte_0609678840: old icon reference in jnlp single-instance code corrected.  Thanks daekyu!
            <li>1952: Ivar had a code which showed where a check for each of 5000000 points' properties was slowing things down, this test is limited to QDataSet.MAX_PLANE_COUNT (=50) now..

            <li>AutoplotDataServer supports HAPI by generating info and data responses.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>tune huge scatter for when data units are the same as axis units.
            <li>FDataSet can provide access to raw float values, avoiding numerical noise from float-to-double casting, using new capability.
