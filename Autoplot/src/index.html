        <p><small>The trim1 operator now supports rank 2 DEPEND_1, where the DEPEND_1 records change for each record.  Here's a <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/demos/20190709/changingCadenceTrim.jy'>script</a> which demos.
            </small></p>            
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2019a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2019-07-09 r23857):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2187: support trim(1,'2Hz','4Hz') with rank 2 depend 1.
            <li>2185: when a joined zero-length dataset is encountered temporarily catch the error so that other functionality is still accessible.  Thanks, Firdevs!
            <li>2149: rte_1223982323 corrected, where code assumed binding was to another axis, when it could be dom.timeRange.  Thanks, lehanson!
            <li>2184: bug with plot(1,...) when (1) is moved to plot above.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>Masafumi needed to load TCA data from a das2server at 1ms resolution.
            <li>2182: DESCRIPTION metadata is loaded from CDF files, propagated, and formatted properly.  Metadata tab displays DESCRIPTION properly.
            <li>ftp filesystem supports .gz files (though they are still not cached properly).  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>rte_0195003323: avoid runtime errors on event thread when when enumeration units get into the wrong place.
            <li>finally clip the legend and message bubbles to within the plot boundaries.  This has been bugging me for a while.
            <li>loosen constraints on CDAWeb reader for all.xml, in anticipation of website changes CDAWeb will be making.
            <li>autolayout code has sanity check on ymin, where a bug in AutoplotServer when the vap size in pixels is changed.
            <li>Work towards making Gold timetags available (Autoplot offers them now but there's still an issue with the NetCDF library).
            <li>Gold Mission CDF file requests "image" for display type, and this should be ignored.
            <li>1960: NetCDF/HDF5 reader reads global attributes into metadata.
            <li>vap+wdc works again, after discovering that new code assumed there was an extension.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2180: cache failures to read orbits so that we don't keep trying.
            <li>2181: runtime error caused by integer overflow in aggregation of many records.
            <li>2178: old add plot, vap file works again, so you can pick datasets from another vap file.
            <li>reset axis units to now allows reset to data units as well, so that 'inconvertible units' can be addressed.
            <li>2174: run batch doesn't store the name of the script for convenience.
            <li>2065: recent .jy URIs with the parameters are now used for the recent URIs list in the "Run Batch" tool.
            <li>1980: copy/paste plot problems fixed.  
            <li>PropertyEditor listenForExternalChanges now recurses through all the beans, supporting the Autoplot DOM.
            <li>corrections to code which calculates minor ticks given a set of major ticks.
            <li>Submit feedback failed on Java 12 because of xml serialization, which no longer accepts null values.
            <li>rte_0786587992: automatically remove single quotes from URIs, which prevent vap+jyds URIs from working in the mash up tool.
            <li>2171: new code in DasProgressMonitor was incorrect and could hang.
            <li>paste plots from clipboard was too restrictive in validity test.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li>correct runtime error when DasAnnotation couldn't load image file.
            <li>"convert Jython to Java" didn't set the popup background color.
            <li>2166: ".../foo.jyds?param=" fixed, where empty parameters are treated the same as missing parameters, using default values.
            <li>round of memory leaks testing.  See https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/bugs/2054/stressTestForLeaks.jy
            <li>rte 1625162004: runtime error because of units during transition
            <li>contours renderer was painting the off-screen labels, degrading performance.
            <li>Propagate USER_PROPERTIES through FFTPower so that Juno waveforms don't show extraneous %{USER_PROPERTIES} in title.
            <li>2127: .../mms1_feeps_srvy_l3_electron_20180928000000_v6.0.1.cdf?intensity_energy_bins[0] showed there was an issue.  Thanks, Allison!
            <li>2164: mouse module (e.g. box zoom) feedback is restored.  Thanks, Masafumi!
            <li>2149: experiments with autorange considering bindings.
