        <p><small>Bird song rendered as spectrogram, and a context overview is used to zoom in.  Images as annotations can now be scaled.  Happy Fall!

        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot2018a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2018-09-21 r22848):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2037: correctly read valid_min, valid_max, and fill_value from dscovr files.
            <li>2013: loading vap should not automatically move spectrograms under line plots.
            <li>improve error feedback when DatumRange string is passed to the Datum parser.
            <li>2034: reset method must cancel existing monitors on the reset thread.
            <li>2032: extraneous decimal point in tick labels.
            <li>peaks in stacked histogram renderer didn't clip properly.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>2029: cdaweb filter apply_esa_flag used old code that relied on monitor reuse, which is no longer allowed.
            <li>2029: CDF virtual variables would not load because of tighter handling of monitors and sloppy code.
            <li>CDF source's slice1 parameter should better match |slice1.
            <li>add TableRowSorter which minds the data type.  Thanks, Masafumi for pointing this out!
            <li>rename codes within CDF reader to be more consistent.
            <li>completions work when coding in indented bug.
            <li>2025: HAPI GUI failed to initialize properly when the id was already set.
            <li>rte_1870708520: catch runtime exception when trying to find aggregations.
            <li>2016: plot title macros should always listen to the first plotElement.
            <li>Findbugs tests restored and a round of Findbugs citations were resolved.
            <li>Auralizer code would show index out of bounds with some data, check for constant data. 
            <li>AggregatingDataSourceFactory.getFileStorageModel(uri) would fail if the uri didn't have any fields.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Fits reader supports where default object is not a readable table.
            <li>Matlab export options was using the IDL options dialog.
            <li>horizontal and vertical slicers allow units sloppiness.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>"clean" method removed from Matlab export to support compiling under Java 9.  Thanks, Dan!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>removed bit of experimental code would fail to connect symbols when data contained non-monotonic tags, which was inadvertently released.
            <li>2022: new, more careful code had new bug where it could hang process.
            <li>Corrections to handling of Socket Timeouts (server down), properly fall into offline mode when remote server is off-line.
            <li>2020: logging checkboxes were not initialized properly.
            <li>2021: clarification and correction of DataPointRecorder.select javadoc.
            <li>2022: minor clean-up in layout listener changes support, where one path would fail to see a change was still pending.  (Bug 1022 lingers)
            <li>Dan fixed Java 9 ambiguity with Class Module.
            <li>2017: bug where weights with incorrect rank would cause RTE on event thread, and replicate properly handles WEIGHTS now.
            <li>rte_2038937185: correct the poor error message reported ("unrecognized units:00") for parseDatumRange('2017-001 03:00 to 02:00')
            <li>confusing error message for dr[indgen(4)]=findgen(5), make more precise.  Loosen test slightly, See "svn log -r22709:22710"
            <li>FileSystem's unzip action now handles where NetCDF .jar file had missing files, issuing warning instead of crashing.
            <li>2015: show keystrokes for editor "find usages" and "plot" actions, corrections to "plot" action.
            <li>corrections to "trim" filter GUI.
            <li>rte 276343956: transitional case in "isSomeoneListening" caused RTE.  Make local copies for thread safety.

            <li>Matlab and IDL export methods check for non-qubes.

            <li>HAPI uses server_list.txt now instead of all.txt.
            <li>binAverage reduction method used old QDataSet form which is no longer used (indexed property vs slice then property).
            <li>rte_0183234259: Corrections to Das2Server authentication dialog, such as NullPointerException and allow scientist to opt out when password is not known.
            <li>rte 1924252302: "display data" mouse action correctly uses format specifiers found in data.
            <li>SeriesRenderer, when data breaks exist on both sides of a valid point, would fail to draw the point.
            <li>1999: correct error message in ASCII when non-existent column is requested.
            <li>new data set builder nextRecords function had a bug where 0th record was always copied.  Thanks, Ivar!
