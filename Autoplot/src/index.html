        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2020a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2020-02-26 r24634):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2252: FFTPower with slide option can span records.
            <li>2251: handle strange bug where GitLabs us suddenly adding a /-/ to URLs
            <li>2249: copy plot, insert plotElements doesn't reset style and symbol size.  Thanks, Jon N!
            <li>2249: copy plot, insert plotElements from clipboard would result in NullPointerException.  Thanks, Jon N!
            <li>2250: .pngwalk file with spaces, which happens when Windows downloads files in the browser, are properly supported.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>2248: Jython script could not contain a space in the name of the resource URI when Jython Extensions were used, as with .sps files.  Thanks, Shing!
            <li>Jython addTab now checks to see if the added component has embedded scrollpanes (in split pane, for example) before adding a scrollpane automatically.
            <li>rfe704: corrections to GUI generation.  Thanks, kh6sky!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2245: HAPI issues with UCLA PDS-PPI server, like excessive and unnecessary escaping of URLs.
            <li>2243: vertical slice of spectrogram created by list of X,Y,Z triples works now.  Plot command accepts rank 0 data.
            <li>1687: as symbols are imported, add them to the list of variableNames in code that simplifies Jython.
            <li>correct code counting () and {}, to support turning Matisse GUI builder code into Jython.  See <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/demos/guis/demoMatisseGUI.jy'>this</a>.
            <li>2240: ftp servers can now use alternate ports, supporting ad-hoc servers on phones.
            <li>rfe704: add script to tools uses setScriptLabel and setScriptTitle for menu label.
            <li>Colors are encoded in vaps as "#040404 (Dark Gray)", to improve readability of .vap files.
            <li>2239: Time Range Tool's NRT tab clean up, use DasAxis to show new setting. 
            <li>improve feedback for truncated CDF file.
            <li>1801: applyUnaryOp performance improved for rank 1 data.
            <li>2235: atan2 documentation tweak
            <li>getApplication().getScriptPanel() would return the editor, not the entire panel.  Codes should use getApplication().getScriptEditor() for this.
            <li>bugfix:autoplot --script=https://github.com/.../extractReferences.jy didn't work because it would load the html from GitHub directly, not via GitHubFileSystem.
            <li>clean up of old code which allowed loading URIs found in .vap file.
            <li>2114: Support <a href="https://github.com/autoplot/documentation/wiki/QDataSet.Schemes#vector-time-series">vector array</a> in NetCDF file using CDAWeb metadata.  Thanks, Andres!
            <li>bugfix parse of |cleanData(11) 
            <li>2241: rfe 1978078909: check for null selection in CDFEditorPanel, and review use of all JTrees.  Thanks, Dan!
            <li>clean up of row change events to fix noise problems on Jenkins server.
            <li>2241: 064169462: multi-variable selection in CDF editor could lead to NullPointerException.  Thanks, pmaf and orufai!
            <li>242122682: condition where ...cdf?var[:,0] would result in runtime error.
            <li>experiment with Level.CONFIG, to be used to log client use of DasCanvas.
            <li>getCompletions call of CDF would download file, the monitor was used twice.
            <li>editor javadoc location is tolerant of paths missing final /, and generated URLs should not have spaces for <a href="http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~jbf/autoplot/doc">new location</a>.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add experimental "Ok Save Next" button to PNGWalk Quality Control code to speed up common workflow.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>new "Editor Bookmarks" actions allows actions like <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/demos/tools/editor/pull.jy'>pull</a> to be added to the editor menu.
            <li>Throw more abstract error when a CDF variable pointer points to a location past the end of the CDF file.
            <li>DasProgressPanel can be a Java/Swing component, so that it can be part of a GUI.
            <li>1801: speed up binary operations for rank 1-3 operands by avoiding DataSetIterator use, which is known to be slow.  (By a factor of 3-4!)
            <li>currentLine function reports the Jython code name and line number of the call, useful for debugging.
            <li>editor scripts don't need special "editor" and "script" symbols, since they can use getApplication().getScriptPanel().
            <li>360: support Jython "examples":[2,3,4,5] which doesn't require that the value be one of these.
            <li>672: cleanData allows the number of sigmas to be set.
            <li>672: add "cleanData" function which removes data three sigmas away from the mean.
