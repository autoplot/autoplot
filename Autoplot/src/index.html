        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit java versions: <a href="autoplot.jnlp">autoplot.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-06-01 r25784):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/das-developers/das2java/issues/12">0012</a>: series render data reduction can make all data invalid.
            <li>2352: cache MONOTONIC=FALSE, before we would only cache MONOTONIC=TRUE, but determining it is false can be expensive for some data.
            <li>don't mark the Jython variable "_" as unread, so that it can be used in loops to assert that the loop variable is not used.
            <li>remove old warning when das2stream used something besides Units.us2000 for timetags, this was fixed years ago.  Thanks, Chris!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-05-22 r25778):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1848: Das2Server credentials are persistent between sessions.
            <li>2350: limits to interpolation in X was different than Y in spectrograms.
            <li>2342: corrections to contours rendering.
            <li>add note about how to dismiss popup documentation.
            <li>1871: code to keep track of recent times never worked properly, and it should be useful now.
            <li>670: applyIndex didn't handle rank 3 depend 2.
            <li>2348: grid is now drawn under the data, not over.  Let me know if this bugs you and I'll add a control.  Thanks, Ali and others!
            <li>2343: writeToPng would not allow a filename with spaces in it.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>2341: automatic bind-to-app-timerange fails to bind when 3 rows and 2 columns.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2236: $x_$x.png works to trigger the PngWalkTool, so results of Run Batch are more easily viewed.  Start screenshots launches into PngWalk with timetags.
            <li>alt-shift-shift can be used to stop screenshots, since some machines grab control keystroke event.
            <li>2335: new runtime error caused when quoted block contains a / and is split.
            <li>2338: if an aggregation granule dataset doesn't validate, don't mix it into the aggregation.
            <li>2339: report when noCheckCertificates is set in about and runtime submissions.
            <li>2210: create screenshot hangs on a Mac.  Thanks, Joe!
            <li>2335: runtime error with ~/Downloa&lt;T&gt; when Downloads folder contains file with single paren.  Thanks, Brian!
            <li>2333: rte1830566714 shows where TCA result can be null and was not handled.
            <li>start to correct Java 7 complaints in QDataSet.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ephemerisLabels property of each plot allows the ephemeris channels to be manually labeled.
            <li>normalize(ds,1) function added.  Thanks, Kristoff!
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add binData function, which sorts rank 1 data into rank 2 data with sorted into bins.
            <li>Das2Server credentials dialog keeps track of password.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>Parker Solar Probe orbit time intervals added.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>Show color icon in completions.
            <li>increase the number of points limit when calculating stats to 200000000.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Add constants to ColorUtil for 140 named web colors like "CADET_BLUE" to encourage use in scripts.
            <li>USER_PROPERTIES can have map with another nested map.
            <li>rfe406: support &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; in text strings.
            <li>new axis/controller/dasAxis/axisOffset property will allow for multiple axis on the left side of one plot.
            <li>Add annotation dialog controls background color and border, making it easier to add text comments without a box.
            <li>NybbleDataSet putValue now works.  Support for rank 2.
            <li>installTool correctly sets PWD now, so that it can be used in argument lists
            <li>740: warnings about redefining symbols like "plot" or "total" is too noisy, be more careful to only show when there is a problem.  Thanks, Sadie!
	    <li>Jython to Java converter improvements.
            <li>739: DasCore moved to GitHub, along with QDataSet.  Thanks, Chris!
