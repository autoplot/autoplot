            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2020a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2020-08-01 r24988):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2276: PngwalkTool inspect action now shows folders in local file chooser.  Use Java 6 FileNameFileFilter everywhere, reducing code and making things consistent.
            <li>don't replace existing NetCDF units with those found in the ISTP metadata, since the NetCDF ones are more likely to be correct.
            <li>CreatePngWalk no longer allowed single URI to be used in place of .vap.  Add uri= argument which is better anyway.  Thanks, Warren!
            <li>2274: keep track of 401 exceptions so we ask for password again if incorrect password is entered.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>add calendar button to mashup tool.
            <li>1728: set the value of the JComboBox directly, fixing old problem where black to white change was rejected.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>"add plot..." dialog didn't add to recent URIs list when only one URI was used.
            <li>Java8 is now required in the Webstart JNLP file.  (No Java8 code yet.)
            <li>axis reference property didn't load properly from .vap files.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2020-07-13 r24952):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't assume that LABLAXIS in CDF file is string data, and print a warning when it isn't.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>Color Scatter from ASCII file, using X=, Y=, and Z= switches works again.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>bugfix: jump-to-line menu construction assumed classes were always inherited.
            <li>vap+inline:randn(100),randn(100) was mistaken for a mash-up URI.
            <li>selection area (yellow flashes) miscalculated for color scatter mode.
            <li>2269: SeriesRenderer would not clear exception, so returning to correctly-loading interval would not correctly display.  Thanks Chris and Bill!
            <li>occasional half-pixel error when position of image is calculated in SeriesRenderer.
            <li>rte_1424143028: handle non-CDF file error on machine where memory mapping cannot be used.
            <li>triple quotes could cause problems when parsing Jython file to get arguments.
            <li>1674: loose jython work by switching file.
            <li>2262: script editor undo's script load.
            <li>1983: jython error reporting doesn't check file name and can mark the wrong file.
            <li>new irange function had a bug where it would return 1..4 instead of 0..3.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bundle command now has 5, 6, and 7 dataset versions.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Annotation splitAnchor allows annotation X position to anchor to plot edge while Y anchors to data.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>X, Y, and Z, controls supported in ASCII editor.
            <li>pngwalk animated gif output has option to shrink each frame by 60%.
            <li>add lonarr(n) and lonarr(n,m) for storing CDF_TT2000 data.
            <li>Das2 renderer ID is displayed in property tables and can be accessed by scripts.
            <li>backgroundThick property added so that contrasting color is provided by SeriesRenderer.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>rank 2 replicate added.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>lastminute keyword added to times, to provide a way to refer to the last minute elapsed in real-time applications.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
