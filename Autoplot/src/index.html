        <p><small>New qubeSubset Das2Server keyword drops records which would prevent the data from being a qube.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-07-27 r25899):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add @see flattenWaveform to synchronizeNN documentation, since the scientist would typically need to flatten the data first.
            <li>Binary data source can read huge binary files (>2GB), though only 2GB at a time.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>Initial Bookmarks GUI would allow the description and title to be modified, even though no bookmark was selected, causing confusion.
            <li>Data Mash-up tool supports "None" as a parameter, allowing "fftPower" function to be used.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2364/">2364</a>: code which closed Autoplot back-end server removed, so that multiple commands can be sent.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2367/">2367</a>: guess time format mistook four-character "time" for $H$M field.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>if series color scatter data zunits were not convertible to colorbar units, the data was not displayed and no warning message was printed.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2369/">2369</a>: ASCII file reader treats non-breaking spaces, from copying data in email, as whitespace.  Thanks, Sadie!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-06-22 r25825):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/1043/">1043</a>: don't throw error when double question marks found, just issue warning.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2367/">2367</a>: export from slicer allows Autoplot to format the data, but the options were ignored.  Thanks, George!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2363/">2363</a>: ASCII file with X and Y arguments still didn't work because I forgot to commit a bit of code.
            <li>detect two question marks in .jyds URIs, which has a confusing result, and print a warning for now.
            <li>Das2Server source didn't allow single channels of ephemeris source to be selected from older Das2 Servers.  Thanks, Sadie!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add plots with multiple rows finally supports replace current.
            <li>Introduce dom.controller.selectedPlots property.  See <a href='https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/demos/tools/layout/joinPlots.jy'>joinPlots.jy</a> for example use.
            <li>Introduce new qubeSubset which will throw out data until the non-qube can be represented as a qube, to assist with the Das2Server.  Thanks, Terry!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/autoplot/documentation/issues/1">1</a>: use "run" where "execute" is unnecessarily used.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/748">748</a>: second plot window in scripts
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/747">747</a>: event thread response monitor allows manually triggering of thread dump.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/746">746</a>: digitizer should be able to export data to CDF and other formats Autoplot knows.
            <li>added Units.us1970, microseconds since 1970.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
            <li>Bugs often have a four-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/&lt;ID&gt;/.  
            <li>Features typically have a three-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/&lt;ID&gt;/.
        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
