        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2020a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2020-10-03 r25168):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe425: in MashUp tool, use new guessNameFor which guarantees unique names.
            <li>rfe425: in MashUp tool, leave tree branch unfolded when inserting an operation, to minimize changes.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2020-09-30 r25152):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2289: IOException when TAB is pressed in empty data set selector, instead of discovery of types.
            <li>2274: Handle redirect to authenticated URL.  Thanks, Jon N and Kristoff!
            <li>when loading several datasets from CDF into a bundle, all would have the label of the first.  Thanks, Warren!
            <li>rfe694: explicitly handle escape in DataSetSelector, so that it doesn't escape the dialog which contains it.
            <li>2287: handle case where CDF attribute has String for first value and double array for second and third.
            <li>backgroundThick line (used for contrast) would draw with dashes as well, making it unusable with anything other that solid.
            <li>HapiServerDemo, the Autoplot-based HAPI Server, didn't properly handle fill data.
            <li>1486: swap plot position doesn't move the empheris data.
            <li>drag and drop file onto canvas works again on the Mac DMG release.   Thanks, Allison!
            <li>Use new receiver for RTE reports.
            <li>slice2 and slice3 propagate DELTA_PLUS and DELTA_MINUS properties.  Thanks, Mike!
            <li>2282: ASCII table reader would use enumeration units when the first N records were empty fields, even if numeric data followed.  Thanks, Joe!
            <li>ASCII column headers can include granny strings for units, like "N_e(cm!a-3!n)"
            <li>2278: CDF slice1 keyword didn't work when Epoch16 timetags were used.  Thanks, Kristoff!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jython editor has new developer->"Convert Mathematica code to Jython" tool.
            <li>create pngwalk checks for lockfile, so that multiple processes can work on pngwalk in concert.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe425: Mashup will replace parameter names with the names of datasets, so that the tree is valid.
            <li>export to Das2Stream version 2.3 introduced by Chris.
            <li>experimental ColorSeriesRenderer introduced, which allows color along the line.
            <li>Jython-defined renderers can use colorbar.
            <li>add completions for pattern and format for ASCII data source.
            <li>728: Allow multiple, non-adjacent columns of ASCII table to be plotted.  Thanks, In Sook!
            <li>725: Create PNGWalk has checkbox will remove images where no data is visible.  Thanks, In Sook!
            <li>provide GUI to enable and control error bars, used when data contains DELTA_PLUS and DELTA_MINUS.  Thanks, Mike!
            <li>File chooser has types alphabetized and now shows only file-based data sources.  Thanks, Allison!
            <li>HAPI data source shows events bar when only timetags are requested, useful for availability.
            <li>suppress the legend when the plot width is less than 100 pixels.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
            <li>Bugs often have a four-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/&lt;ID&gt;/.

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.

    <p>This is not complete, and limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantities of rank 3 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,pitch) are plotted by slicing.</li>
        <li>Quantities of rank 4 dimensionality (e.g. flux(Time,Energy,azimuth,sector) are plotted by slicing twice.</li>
