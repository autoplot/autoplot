        <p><small>New properties including lineStyle and lineThick added to the events bar plot style.
            </small></p>
        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2020a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2020-12-04 r25368):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2309: DataPointRecorder units change when emptied.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>1779: copy/paste plot is more aggressive about trying to bind the pasted plot's x-axis to the timerange.  Thanks, Bill!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2020-12-02 r25360):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PNGWalkTool data-to-pixel transform had discontinuity at axis edge.  Now there is an output limit of -10000 to 10000, which is consistent with the DasAxis object.
            <li>Datums backed by Long but not Units.cdfTT2000 would cause runtime error when printed.
            <li>2305: doAxisDimensionsChange returned false, causing reset which resulted in using old dataset for axis labels.
            <li>1636: corrections to Jython code refactoring (simplification of script to get params or for completions) after it was discovered that test server was failing to notify.  Simplification of codes.
            <li>2304: Another round of localization checks is needed, das2server check.  Thanks, Corentin!
            <li>2303: histogram filter didn't properly handle decimal arguments.
            <li>2302: File->Open Vap file breaks when remote URI is in address bar.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>rte_1637324209: occasional runtime error when loading vap, associated with new error bar controls.  Thanks, Bill!
            <li>2300: script plot command toggles through invalid intermediate state, experiments with reset. 
            <li>multi-line string used with setScriptDescription would cause parse error.
            <li>In Mathematica to Jython, properly handle "2754 2^(2/3)"
            <li>medianFilter would fail if there was too much fill data.  Thanks, Kristoff!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>events bar supports lineStyle and lineThick properties, new opaque property disables transparency.  Thanks, Ali!
            <li>getFile can have null passed in for the monitor, when the developer knows the load will be quick.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe501: allow custom mouse event handler and topDecorator to be added to the PNGWalkTool.
            <li>rfe704: setScriptDescription can have a clickable link.
            <li>referenceX and referenceY allow list of datums to point at or mark with symbol in annotations.
            <li>anchorBackground property allows regions to be highlighted in annotations.
            <li>rfe734: bundle URI keyword for ASCII files should return bundle descriptor
            <li>add annotations list on the layout tab.  Thanks, Kristoff!
            <li>rfe363: check version of Javadoc when deciding how to create link.
            <li>rfe363: finally "addToSearchPath"'s Javadoc argument is used for Javadoc completions. (To be shown at 2020 AGU.)
            <li>rfe363: first batch of new icons showing Java static method vs instance method, properly filter by context.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
            <li>Bugs often have a four-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/&lt;ID&gt;/.

        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
