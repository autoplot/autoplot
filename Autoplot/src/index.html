        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2021-03-22 r25638):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bugfix: lanlNNSpectrogram's use of samePopulation would crash if ds1 or ds2 was constant, causing "width is zero" message.
            <li>2321: correction to Webstart release, after I failed to properly update the JNLP files.  Thanks, Darrell!
            <li>mechanism for identifying Javadoc version used by each package was slow, so redo it so that each jar IDs version just once.
            <li>GitLabs support handles space-physics/juno/ap-script/-/blob/, where three path elements are found before.
            <li>change "failure #2 to deal with another day" message to fine, as it apparently doesn't cause any problems.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-02-06 r25519):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bug 2318: reject stuck in loop because dataSetSelector is not reset properly. 
            <li>hang_1409362814: correction where overzealous code would create condition which could hang Autoplot GUI.
            <li>rfe737: "for" and "while" handled properly in static code analysis.
            <li>ASCII file containing datum column headers with units would cause runtime error.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>corrections to error bars, where BIN_PLUS, BIN_MINUS, BIN_MAX, and BIN_MIN are handled with Series Renderer error bars.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>rfe737: more Python reserved words are recognized.
            <li>runtime error when script editor is up and it crashes, because line number was not properly extracted.
            <li>Corrections to PDSDataSource, where it was missing libraries.
            <li>Jython completions don't show (Object,Object) version of command that takes (QDataSet,QDataSet).
            <li>1816: bundle subset propagates bundle properties.
            <li>1816: tweak string representation of a QDataSet for bundles.
            <li>1816: allow bundle to have times for column 0 and DEPEND_0, and not format the column twice to an ASCII file.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>check cadence when displaying timetags, and use more digits to show cadence.  Thanks, Jolene!
            <li>improvements to Jython completions allows variable completions on assignments to functions.
            <li>GitLabs support checks for login redirect and throws meaningful error message.
            <li>expose DasAxis labelOffset property, since it is useful to the scientists.
            <li>refactor zip support to treat .kmz files as zip files, more to come.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>737: Jython Static Code Analysis detects unused imports.
            <li>738: bundles with references to bundled DELTA_PLUS, BIN_MAX, etc.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>das2stream parser supports error bars.  Thanks, Chris!
            <li>Jython getDataSet calls are logged to logger "jython.script.ds" for easier access.
            <li>729: initial support for PDS4 data using pds4-jparser.
            <li>Autoplot-based HAPI server has experimental support for packet ingest.
            <li>add averager for range in y.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
