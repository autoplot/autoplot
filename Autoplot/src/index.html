        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2020a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2020-11-07 r25260):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2300: script plot command toggles through invalid intermediate state, experiments with reset. 
            <li>multi-line string used with setScriptDescription would cause parse error.
            <li>In Mathematica to Jython, properly handle "2754 2^(2/3)"
            <li>medianFilter would fail if there was too much fill data.  Thanks, Kristoff!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2020-09-30 r25152):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NegativeArraySizeException in intermediate state of SeriesRenderer, when log axis is used and plot has not been sized.  Thanks, Jon N!
            <li>2290: unbundle filter GUI contained bug which would insert extra quote in the argument.
            <li>recent change to pngWalkTool didn't consider one of the initialization modes.
            <li>datumRange constructor which took two long-backed cdf_tt2000 datums would convert the end datum unnecessarily, introducing numerical noise.
            <li>correction to FTP so that user:pass is only requested once, anonymous ftp is dropped.
            <li>HAPI server transactions should use UTF-8 and not the system default encoding.  Thanks, Vincent and Benjamin!
            <li>Tooltip on progress monitor, which is never truncated, shows transfer rate.
            <li>2295: improvements to automatic variable name selection.
            <li>improve support for huge CDF files (&gt;2G), by removing a check which assumed that the ByteBuffer was a mapping of the entire file. Improve feedback.
            <li>When PNGWalk has roughly the expected number of files, don't count off intervals, which causes problems when 10-day plots start at year boundaries.
            <li>Yearly update of digital signature for JNLP.
            <li>2292: bugfix in DataSourceUtil.trimScatterToTimeRange, which didn't find the timetags when three timeseries datasets were bundled.  Thanks, Allison!
            <li>2292: correction to the timerange used in the resultant dataset.  
            <li>2292: mashup tool now puts current list of URIs into the recent URIs, for easier to create URIs of that other datasets from the same file.  Thanks, Allison!
            <li>2292: mashup tool now removes timerange from each URI, which was cluttered and confusing.  
            <li>rfe425: in MashUp tool, use new guessNameFor which guarantees unique names.
            <li>rfe425: in MashUp tool, leave tree branch unfolded when inserting an operation, to minimize changes.
            <li>graphical ProgressMonitor shows rate in tooltip as well as the status.
            <li>there was a path where the keychain file would get a file for credentials, not the folder the file is within.
            <li>correction to "show error bars" binding, the initial setting should be disabled.
            <li>bugfix: SerializeDelegate was not added for ErrorBarType
            <li>rte_1611550558: index out of bounds in misformatted time resulted in poor error feedback.  Thanks dphartley!
            <li>rte_1611550558: old $x for localized m/d/Y or d.m.Y was leftover in old code, which could be confusing.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe363: check version of Javadoc when deciding how to create link.
            <li>rfe363: finally "addToSearchPath"'s Javadoc argument is used for Javadoc completions. (To be shown at 2020 AGU.)
            <li>rfe363: first batch of new icons showing Java static method vs instance method, properly filter by context.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>create pngwalk shows processing rate based on last 20 images, not the whole run, so that parallel processing is improved.
            <li>Jython editor has new developer->"Convert Mathematica code to Jython" tool.
            <li>create pngwalk checks for lockfile, so that multiple processes can work on pngwalk in concert.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/?limit=1000">see Source Forge</a>
            <li>Bugs often have a four-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/&lt;ID&gt;/.  
            <li>Features typically have a three-digit ID and can be reviewed with https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/&lt;ID&gt;/.
        </ul>
        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
