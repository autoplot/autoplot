        <p><small>X Axis' new "tickValues" property, here set to "+30", is used to nicely locate ticks in angles space.  See <a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/469/'>ticket 469</a>.
            </small></p>            
        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2019a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2019-05-18 r23695):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2155: display data on bundle of X,Y,Z didn't clip on Y.
            <li>URI_Template's phasestart modifier was never implemented.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>2158: setItemAllLists( rank0, rank0, rank1) now reconciles the three properly.  Thanks, Bill!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2155: automatically set digitizer "sorted" property so that pixel locations don't clobber each other.
            <li>TITLE property was printed twice in ASCII export.
            <li>2133: bug in Datum.Long to TimeStruct, where leap seconds were handled incorrectly, was corrected.  Thanks, Darrell!
            <li>%{TIMERANGE} macro can convert back to orbit number.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2154: support assignment of fill to dataset, where fill is copied or translated to the dataset's fill value.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>bug with new --quiet switch with AutoplotDataServer corrected.  
            <li>1670: check for weight=0 with value=NaN, some codes assumed weight*value was valid.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2148: shift-execute correctly brings up the parameters dialog in the script editor.
            <li>2148: .jy scripts now get lint to check for common mistakes, before just .jyds scripts did.
            <li>check for duplicate entries in CDAWeb file-finding service.  This is a bug they will fix as well.
            <li>2140: top and bottom painters are automatically antialiased and have their own graphics context to protect other parts of the plot.
            <li>2140: add support for DasPlot top and bottom decorators.
            <li>2147: data reduction with series renderer and small pixels would result in washed-out image.
            <li>2146: autolayout incorrectly reclaims room for TCAs, adding noise to vap loading.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li>doDataSetReduce of SeriesRenderer now reduces to 1/2 pixel, so that "1px" sized black dots appear black.
            <li>performance improvements to the HugeScatterRenderer.
            <li>2145: avoid infinite loop in Events List when there are no events in the next intervals.
            <li>corrections to other bugs with the HAPI client when caching was turned on.
            <li>performance improvements with new Das2Stream reader, along minor bugs pointed out by Jenkins tests.

            <li>2143: HAPI client respects dataset time boundaries when caching is enabled.
            <li>rebinner API now passes information about the Z axis so interpolation can be fixed.
            <li>"polar" render type corrects units.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe469: Axis nodes have "tickValues" property which allows tick spacing and location to be specified manually.
            <li>rfe680: Expect utility included now to support driving other applications like FTP and IDL.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rfe677: redo the GUI for the display data dialog, so you can see and control the yclipping.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>rfe678: add mad function!  Thanks, Ivar.
            <li>PngWalkTool's write to animated gif and write to pdf file now have a button to copy the output filename to the clipboard.

            <li>file download now logs transfer rates to das2.filesystem.wfs at FINER.

            <li>ImageVectorDataSetRenderer renamed to HugeScatterRebinner.
            <li>Autoplot-based HAPI Server supports If-Modified-Since header.
