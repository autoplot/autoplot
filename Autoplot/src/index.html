        <p>Autoplot attempts to allow plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers.
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2019a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 7 is now required.  Java 8 will be required sometime soon.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 4GB of memory (64-bit Java only): <a href="autoplot_4GB.jnlp">autoplot_4GB.jnlp</a></p>
        
        <p>Single-jar version, <a href="autoplot.jar">autoplot.jar</a>, can be run without network access and from the command line.</p>

        <p><a href="http://autoplot.org/data/build/mac/Autoplot-dev.dmg">Mac DMG Release</a> is available. 
        
        <p>Bugfixes (2019-04-08 r23545):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2138: when using X,Y,Z feature of CDF editor, Y metadata shown initially, not the Z data.
            <li>2127: code which appended virtual records on CDF variables which were too short didn't consider virtual variables.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li>0875: old branch was using aggregated URI in getDataSourceEditorPanel, causing bogus hit to remote servers.
            <li>fall back to two columns when column count cannot be guessed with ASCII files, so that the editor shows the file instead of nothing.
            <li>2137: support for decimal years.
            <li>1629: NullPointerException in code which would verify Jython index.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>2136: when initial load results in "no data" still support TSB.  Thanks, Baptiste and Chris!
            <li>orbits file would use old http, not https locations.
            <li>2103: tick layout is done using floats, so that pdf output has uniform ticks.
            <li>1678: bind with the plot colorbar the source so that the new plotElements have to comply.
            <li>2133: detect LongReadAccess when CDF_TT2000 is used for timetags, so that CDF timetags can be formatted to ASCII with full resolution.  Thanks, Eric!
            <li>2036: keep track of the parent of the monitor used for centering, after seeing that the hidden monitor would position properly when it becomes visible.
            <li>1629: getItem with index lists (ds[ idx0, idx1, 0 ]) works now.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>2134: support rank 2 indeces, see https://github.com/autoplot/dev/blob/master/bugs/2134/
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2036: monitors should be centered above the context which created them.
            <li>2132: aggregation with local files on Windows corrected when $Y/$m/$Y$m$d.cdf is used with network drive.  Thanks, Seth!
            <li>2131: cdf editor does not say "0 records of CDF_FLOAT" when the CDAWeb source is used.
            <li>2131: datasource filters GUI is turned on whenever it is used.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li>2131: re-implement where parent plotElement's component change implies that this child should change its component.
            <li>2126: review BASIC mode, where new components were added without considering this constraint.
            <li>2129: stacked histogram runtime error when there is no data and we are zoomed in.
            <li>2130: aggregate dialog doesn't replace the dataSetSelector address, which is confusing.
            <li>1762: two different codes were used to create GUIs for jy and jyds scripts, this is finally fixed, correcting a problem with .jyds layout as well.
            <li>check for infinite min or max required that they both be infinite, now both must be finite.
            <li>2127: support CDF variables with trailing virtual fill records, when fill was never written.  Improvements to the editor.
            <li>1310: experiment with code to check that a script has been run before.
            <li>1687: support documentation at completion "tp=TimePars&lt;C&gt;"
            <li>rte_1199189909: reset zoom on image would result in runtime error.  Thanks, Bob!
            <li>2111: Series renderer dataset reduction branch doesn't support sloppy units (rte_0195003323). Thanks, Kris!
            <li>2122: Autoplot appears off-screen on some windows configurations.  Thanks, Scott!
            <li>export to 2-channel wave with scale=T would clip because the shift was incorrect.  Thanks, Larry!
            <li>0292: support $Y/$m/mms1_fgm_srvy_l2_$Y$m$d in automatic aggregation suggestions.  Thanks, Kris!
            <li>2105: allow direct access of GitHub files, or other sites when the parent http folder listing results in error 400.  Thanks, Bob!
