        <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and OpenDAP servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Bugfixes (2021-09-02 r25999):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ivar pointed out that draw grid caused lineplots to have transparency to them.  Thanks Ivar!
            <li>Remove temporarily use http for runtime errors, not https, since jfaden.net https certificate is fixed.
            <li>2383: exception reports and about menu show launch mechanism used.
            <li>"fix layout" will also remove gaps horizontally when multiple columns are used.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Temporarily use http for runtime errors, not https, since jfaden.net https certificate is broken.
            <li>triple quoted strings would always move the lastLine pointer, sometimes preventing the GUI creation from the address bar.
            <li>Ephemeris lines are limited to 32 lines, was 10.  Thanks, James!
            <li>2378: add setDepend0Cadence, setDepend1Cadence, and setValidRange so these are accessible in scripts.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>round of Findbugs cleanup to get down to 80 flagged issues.
            <li>2380: Correction to append, used with aggregation, when "where" is used with rank 2 CDF datasets.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li>Safety check on putProperty UNITS on FDataSet for TimeLocationUnits didn't consider that None (null) is a valid setting.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Vertical Spectrogram Averager was broken for the rank 2 (Z[X,Y]) case.
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2021-07-06 r25854):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BinaryDataSource throws a more actionable error message when it is instructed to read past the end of a file.
            <li>.sps and .spd Jython extensions moved from server at U. Iowa to <a href="https://github.com/autoplot/scripts/tree/master/formats/sps">GitHub</a>
            <li>timerange completions corrected for CDAWeb source, to support scripting.
            <li>GitHubFileSystem supports listings from GitHub, before you could only access files if the name was known already.  GitLabs still needs work.
            <li>return type of the function call was sometimes mis-reported in Jython completions, as in convertUnitsTo.
            <li><a href='https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2376/'>2376</a>: some of the set item methods in Jython mishandled the units.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>Unpushed change which caused a bug in the ASCII reader was pushed unknowingly and was never tested in last devel release.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2375/">2375</a>: new code to show "add tool" checkbox on script parameters tab broke GUI in one case.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2374/">2374</a>: StaticCodeAnalysis.showUsage corrects incorrect offsets when cos((myvar)) is used, where the double parens show bug in Jython.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Binary data source reportOffset uses T and F now, to match other data sources.
            <li>add @see flattenWaveform to synchronizeNN documentation, since the scientist would typically need to flatten the data first.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Binary data source can read huge binary files (>2GB), though only 2GB at a time.  Thanks, Darrelle!
            <li>Initial Bookmarks GUI would allow the description and title to be modified, even though no bookmark was selected, causing confusion.
            <li>Data Mash-up tool supports "None" as a parameter, allowing "fftPower" function to be used.  Thanks, Andrei!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2364/">2364</a>: code which closed Autoplot back-end server removed, so that multiple commands can be sent.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2367/">2367</a>: guess time format mistook four-character "time" for $H$M field.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>if series color scatter data zunits were not convertible to colorbar units, the data was not displayed and no warning message was printed.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2369/">2369</a>: ASCII file reader treats non-breaking spaces, from copying data in email, as whitespace.  Thanks, Sadie!
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>eventsDiff function introduced to show differences in lists and inserts, deletes, and changes.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>"add plots" dialog now allows stack of plots to be added to the right or left.  Thanks, Ivar!
            <li>introduce <a href='http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~jbf/autoplot/javadoc2018/org/das2/qds/ops/Ops.html#triangulate-org.das2.qds.QDataSet-org.das2.qds.QDataSet-'>triangulate</a> routine to expose this internal functionality.
            <li>new JNLP file works on both 32 bit and 64 bit machines, giving 4 GB to 64 bit machines.
            <li>PDS4 source has experimental logic for resolving dependencies between dependent and independent parameters.
            <li>OperationsProcessor.process(ds,str) introduced to correct order of operands (dataset should come first, conventionally).

            <li>Introduce new qubeSubset which will throw out data until the non-qube can be represented as a qube, to assist with the Das2Server.  Thanks, Terry!
            <li><a href="https://github.com/autoplot/documentation/issues/1">1</a>: use "run" where "execute" is unnecessarily used.
        </ul>
