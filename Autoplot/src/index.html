            </small></p>
            <p>Autoplot allows plotting of data from many data sources, including remote CDF files and HAPI servers. 
	   Datasets are identified with URIs, and by the URI's extension, data are loaded into the internal data model.  Data are then
           displayed by guessing the rendering method and axis ranges to provide a reasonable, useful view of the data.  Data can then 
           be additionally processed with other operations like smooth and FFT, and Jython scripting provides a capable programming environment.
        </p>

        <p>This is the Autoplot v2021a branch.  This is an update to the production version containing bugfixes and minor new features.
            Java 8 is now required.
        </p>

        <p>Run with 1GB of memory to support 32-bit Java versions, and run off of ci-pw build server: <a href="autoplot_1GB.jnlp">autoplot_1GB.jnlp</a></p>
                
        <p>Bugfixes (2022-05-10 r26649):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HttpFileSystem getHeadMetadata had incorrect code when assembing URL for head request.
            <li>PNGWalkTool had excessive synchronized block use, causing hang on Mac.  Thanks, Sadie!
            <li>Autoplot Server feature, where telnet from localhost can control Autoplot, once again allows imports.  Thanks, Simon!
        </ul>
        <p>Older Bugfixes (2022-04-29 r26638):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>improve feedback when "{" is seen in the middle of a HAPI data response, which is an easy mistake for servers to make.
            <li>make it much more likely that the mashup tool result in synchronize data sets to be set.
            <li>new specialColors code didn't handle missing data and would cause runtime error.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2445/">2445</a>: plot makes a copy of the data for defense and for performance.
            <li>check list of renderers for transitional case, where the returned list would be one element too long with a null in the last element.
            <li>remove "Here DELTA" debug message in SubsetDataSet.
            <li>Jython symbol "map" is included in list of quickly executed routines, to support use in generating getParam GUIs.
            <li>suppress warning about SCALEMIN and SCALEMAX when they are NaN, NaN, and just ignore them.
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/bugs/2444/">2444</a>: Run Batch would not create a new interpretter for each run, so information could leak from one run to another.
            <li>Re-run single job of batch would run on event thread, hiding feedback and locking application.
        </ul>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/autoplot/feature-requests/781/">781</a> pngwalk tool "show only QC records" more options
            <li>Minimal specialColors property GUI added to assist in its use.
        </ul>
        <p>Less recent features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>new series icons reflect linethickness.
            <li>allow .vap file in pngwalk using version numbers to check for the versioned .vap file as well.
            <li>allow space or comma to be entered in single field of inline data dialog to speed up data entry in some cases.
            <li>spectrogram icon reflects colorbar used.
            <li>new series icons reflect symbolSize
            <li>completions on plot command now supports completing keyword parameters.
            <li>crossProduct function added.
            <li>Color Scatter mode now has icon.
        </ul>
        <p>Known issues:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>This completes the feature set for the new production branch. No major features will be added before branching this version.
            A production branch will be started in a couple of weeks, and the "Start Autoplot" link at the top of
            autoplot.org will run this version.
